Quality Control,"In the supply chain today, products are being sourced from external vendors.These vendors vary from the highly sophisticated to the highly skilled but withlow access to technology. A few manufacturers have chosen to send theirrepresentatives to each facility to oversee the quality and accuracy of the operation.Others have chosen to instill a high degree of checks when the product is receivedinto their own facilities. Retailers also perform inspection to ensure accuracy andquality of the product they receive from the manufacturers.The Sterling Warehouse Management System Quality Control (QC) helps addressthe quality control procedures that may be achieved at the receiving warehouse.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also ensures quality and accuracy ofthe product shipped out."
Quality Profiling,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System Quality Control module allowsprofiles to be created for a specific vendor or item level. It also allows profiles at avendor or item classification level. For example, all items that are high-value orvendors who are classified as yellow (to indicate vendors who have failed QCbefore). These pre-created profiles in any combination of the mentioned criteriaeliminate manual intervention for normal operations.Inventory upon receipt is marked for diversion using profiles that are created. TheSterling Warehouse Management System directs putaway of product to QCautomatically based on the QC profile."
Quality Inspection,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the ability for a warehouseto inspect products in inventory.The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables a warehouse to apply adisposition to the product. This results in inventory being classified into a specificinventory status, such as Awaiting Inspection, QC Hold, Good Inventory, Scrap.Inventory status may be applied to either at a location level or for a complete itemin a warehouse. Further, inventory status may be restricted to a specific lot andeven a specific serial number. Warehouse may define different reason codes andspecify reason code and additional inspection comments while changing theinventory status.Inventory status as described in inventory control has a direct relationship to theavailability of the product. Any inventory status is categorized as 'not available' or'available'.A quality problem if spotted during inspection process or regular pick and packprocess or during count may require additional inventory to be retrieved fromstorage. The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows for a retrieval requestto be placed at the location, item level, or at the receipt number, lot number levels.For example, safety recalls. Upon completion of ad hoc retrieval tasks, a putawayrequest can be placed for the putaway of SKUs in the QC location."
Inventory Visibility,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows inventory tracking at its mostgranular levels, which include SKU, location and inventory status. Thecombinations of these attributes are better illustrated through the following usecases and examples: View all inventory that have been placed on quality hold due to vendor packingerrorsCriteria used in location inventory console include enterprise, ship node andinventory status View all scrapped inventory in a warehouseCriteria used in location inventory console include enterprise, node, inventorystatus View all inventory that was put on hold for a receipt numberCriteria used in location inventory audit console include enterprise, ship node,receipt number and inventory status."
Task Management,"Task management enables you to manage all warehouse processes in order tooptimize node throughput and maximizing worker efficiency.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation enables you to define the type of task,schedule tasks, assign people to complete those tasks, and raise exceptions whenthey occur to alert appropriate personnel.A task in the warehouse requires definition as to the type of resources (forexample, worker or equipment) authorized to perform the task.The application generates tasks to be performed within the warehouse based oncertain events. For example, receiving triggers a putaway task, wave releasegenerates picking tasks and inventory in a location reaching below definedminimum triggers replenishment tasks.The application enables you to place resource constraints on a task in order tocontrol when and who carries out the task. The dynamic assignment of tasksenables supervisors to reprioritize orders, resulting in automatic reprioritization ofa worker's tasks. A process in a warehouse also has equipment constraints. Forexample, put away to a high-bay location requires the use of a man-up truck or apallet-up truck operated only by authorized users.A task is completed through a paper-based operation, a Radio Frequency (RF)mobile device, or material handling equipment. This enables task management toimprove throughput of the least automated warehouse through paper-basedoperations to the most automated warehouse through RF mobile device andintegration with material handling equipment. In the case of a paper-basedoperation, a batch is printed on request rather than printing up ahead. This enablesreprioritization of orders, cancellation and modification of orders to be reflectedimmediately.The application provides real-time visibility to task status. Task aggregation is alsoprovided for each process and its unique parameters. For example, task visibility ata wave or shipment level."
Task Type,"Each activity in the warehouse has unique characteristics and requires specificoperating procedures. For example, picking requires moving inventory from oneplace to another while counting does not require moving inventory. Each type ofactivity is assigned a task type. Typical task types include the following: Counting Batch picking Order picking Retrieving cases for replenishment Retrieving pallets to the VAS department Packing all picked items into a pallet or carton Preparing carts with empty shipping cartons for picking Putting away pallets from the receiving dockThe application enables you to control task generation and execution at a task typelevel. The controls include the following: Should the task be batched? Does the task go through a drop-off location? Which pick strategy is to be used? Will the task assignment be controlled by the system or will a worker requestthe task?"
Task Dependencies,"Task Management enables you to manage warehouse operations such as picking,packing, and receiving. These operations are accomplished by completing a seriesof tasks. A task is a unit of work that accomplishes a goal. For example, completingan inbound putaway task accomplishes the goal of moving product from thereceiving dock to a storage location. Tasks are composed of one or moreconsecutive steps.A step is the most granular unit of work as defined in Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation. For example, in order to move product from a receivingdock to a bulk storage location, an inbound putaway task can be composed of atwo-step process: First, a pallet jack operator moves the product from a receivingdock to a staging location. Next, a fork lift operator moves the product to the bulkstorage location.Task Management enables you to create dependencies between groups of tasks, sothat one group of tasks can be carried out only after completion of another groupof tasks. For example, a warehouse may want to complete all of the picking tasksassociated with a 10:00 a.m. shipment before beginning the picking tasks associatedwith a 4:00 p.m. shipment."
Task Assignment,"Each type of process in a warehouse typically requires workers who possess aspecific set of characteristics that correspond with the task to be performed. Forexample, computer kit assembly requires workers that understand how theelectronic components are assembled; and picking expensive inventory, such asjewelry, requires security clearances. Each worker is assigned to complete tasks thatmatch their own set of skills or authorization.Skill SetsEach worker may have skills that correspond with multiple task types. In addition,each worker's tasks are prioritized. For example, one worker must complete allputaway tasks before proceeding to replenishment, while another worker mustcomplete replenishment tasks before proceeding to counts.Zones and LocationsYou can define within which specific zones a worker is authorized to performtasksThese constraints control what tasks are displayed to a user and in what sequence.A user on a RF mobile device is expected to login to a console that automaticallydirects them to perform a specific task. The following figure illustrates the taskassignment process.You can define the maximum number of workers who can be assigned to performspecific types of task. For example, if a warehouse chooses order pick, only oneworker carries out the given order. Or for trailer loading, a warehouse allows amaximum of three people to load a trailer.The application automatically suggests the best possible match of task to worker,based on where the user is working and the type of equipment that the user has.The application optimizes task suggestion based on best sequence in which totraverse the location. Additionally, time constraints placed on a task are alsoadhered to.The application has the ability to assign specific tasks and equipment to specificoperators in a warehouse depending on their skill sets. For instance, the warehousesupervisor may assign putaway, picking, replenishment, and packing tasks to anoperator. The forklift or grab truck may be assigned to perform the tasks. Anotheroperator may be assigned to perform the final step of replenishment using onlygrab truck.The application controls when a task is available for assignment. This availability iscomputed from associated date and time constraints for start of the task. Forexample, a putaway request from the quality control department is scheduled tostart only during off-peak time. The task is suggested to all eligible users after thedate and time specified. The expected finish time for a task can also be specified.For example, a move request to top-off high moving dedicated locations in thewarehouse is expected to be completed during the lunch break while picking teamis on the lunch break, then the application suggests tasks that are closer to theirfinish time.You can define the number of users allowed to work simultaneously in an aisle oraisle-section. The application can suggest tasks from an aisle/location only if thenumber of users does not violate the maximum users allowed.You can also permit only one user to work in a location at a time. The applicationcannot suggest tasks from a location, if another user is working in the samelocation.Also, while depositing, the application can consider above settings and prefer aleast congested aisle to suggest deposit tasks."
Task Execution,"Regardless of the use of technology employed in your warehouse, a task can becompleted by using any of the following techniques:Batch sheets Handheld RF mobile devices Material handling equipmentsAs tasks are completed, their status is tracked and may be audited. Task statusesincluding the following: Open Suggested In Progress Held Complete CancelledWhen assigning tasks to the users, the application suggests tasks to the users basedon the skills set and constraints assigned to the users. For example, after a userpicks up the first task of a truck load shipment, he is restricted to executing alltasks for that particular shipment before continuing to the next shipment in thetruck load.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also allows the user to choose thetype of task to perform using the Mobile Application. When performing tasks, theSterling Warehouse Management System allows the user to: Select the specific type of task to perform or the system suggests the next task tobe performed by the user. Pick less than the task quantity when inventory is not available at the locationfor the task performed. Deposit quantity less than the system suggested quantity when the space in thelocation cannot be utilized for the task performed.After the user completes all the tasks, the system suggests the next task to the user,when available. During task execution, the system audits exceptions and overrides,if any.Task execution is better explained utilizing a process as a reference. Therefore,further constraints are better explained under each department. For example,putaway execution is detailed under inventory control section and receiving isdetailed under the inbound execution section."
Task Management Visibility,"The application provides granular visibility to the task. Tasks are viewed by tasktype and status. The following examples or use cases explain the combinations ofattributes:View all pick tasks due to start in the next hourCriteria used includes warehouse, task type, start task after date and time View all pick tasks associated with a particular SKUCriteria used includes warehouse, task type, item and status View all pick tasks that are on holdCriteria used includes warehouse, task type, reason code and status View all replenishment tasks associated with a waveCriteria used includes warehouse, task type and wave number View all replenishment tasks associated with a location or zoneCriteria used includes warehouse, task type, target location, target zone andstatus"
Batching,"A batch represents a list of tasks that can be performed together. Only specific tasktypes can be combined into a batch and each batch consists of only one type oftask. The type of task is determined based on the pick strategy.If a container and shipment has multiple types of pick tasks, the container andshipment is split into multiple batches and consolidation is required for packingand shipping. Batching is used in many scenarios, including the following: Outbound Shipments (with or without containers) Replenishments Work Order Pick Put away (Inbound, Work Order, Replenishment final step)Batch SizeBatch size depends on the type of task. Batch size can be defined by variousparameters such as the following: Maximum number of transactions (task reference such as wave number,containers, shipments or work orders) Maximum volume Maximum number of tasksBatch size is also determined by the following factors: The capacity of the picking equipment used, since different types of tasks mayrequire different sizes of carts The potential volume and dimensions of the shipping carton, whencontainerization is being performed The real volume and dimensions of the items, when being packaged into ashipmentThe application assumes that picking carts are available for any number of batchescreated but does not consider the inventory availability of picking carts.When a batch is created, it is not automatically assigned a specific cart number;however, during the picking process, a specific cart can be associated with thatbatch.Equipment used for batching must have at least one location. Each cart can havemultiple locations. When cart locations are defined, in addition to the maximumlimits specified for the batch, the size of the batch is also restricted based on thecart location definition.Batch CreationBatches can be created manually or triggered automatically, and the algorithm forbatch triggering is extensible.Manual Batch CreationDuring the manual creation of a batch, a user can scan a set of containers andshipments and request the application to create a batch based on those items. Or ina pick and pass environment, each picker in a zone may create a batch for efficientpicking of multiple containers and shipments in a zone. Lists of containers andshipments for a batch can change from one zone to another.Automatic Batch CreationAutomatic batch creation can be triggered by any of the following means:Created and printed online—when the user is waiting for the batch to printbefore executing the next receipt. For example, if receipts are recorded on apallet, when a user closes pallet, all put away tasks for the pallet need to bebatched together and printed immediately. Event triggered—such as Wave Release and ASN Closure. Time triggered—when batching is time triggered, batching may be triggered torun for a specific type of task. The maximum number of batches to be createdcan also be specified. Users may request creation of next batch for a specific task type. On request, theapplication creates one batch and print batch created. In this scenario, creation ofbatch is postponed until the last minute to gain maximum picking efficiency.Cost Based OptimizationThe Sterling Warehouse Management System optimizes the batch created byassociating costs with criteria, which includes locations, aisles, zones and locations.The cost is determined by using the Standard Allowed Minutes (SAM) against thetask type. The list of tasks to create a batch are run through multiple iterations inthe cost based optimizer. At each iteration the previous iteration's result is furtheroptimized. During each iteration the cost is compared and the least cost optionchosen as the best batch.During the process of optimizing the batch constraints standard constraintsincluding a container not being split across batches or when creating a batch fororder pick a shipment is not split across batches. Equipment capacity defined isconsidered to determine the maximum number of units or containers that can beon a batch. Additionally, task type configuration based on the maximum numberof primary references is also considered to limit the batch size. For example,during outbound pick, shipment number or container number is referenced orduring work order pick, work order number is a primary reference.Batch Picking ExecutionPicking for a batch can be through any of the following methods. Printing Batch Sheets—the application can print a batch sheet during any of thefollowing events:– During wave release process– As and when batches are created– Users requesting next batch to print (dispatching a batch to printer) Users can carry out the picking process using printed batch sheet and reportpicking process to the application. The printed batch sheet can be formattedaccording to the type of batch as follows:– Batch of Containers, sort while picking– Batch of Shipments, sort while picking– Batch of containers, no sorting while picking– Batch of Shipments, no sorting while pickingWhen a batch sheet is printed, in addition to batch number, the application canprint check digit and code mapping. In a paper-based picking environment, theuser may be required to enter this check digit or code during batch confirmation.This is to ensure that batches are confirmed on system only subsequent to printingof the batch sheets.Batch sheet printout also includes any special instructions (for example, put away,picking, packing) based on the following criteria: SKU being picked Customer OrderWhile confirming batch sheets, all exceptions such as short picks, over picks, anddamages can be recorded and corresponding event or actions can be taken toaddress these exceptions.Executing Pick Using Handheld DevicesUsers can initiate pick for a batch by scanning a batch sheet or the application cansuggest a batch to a user for picking. Picking can be completed using handhelddevices by scanning location, item bar code, a shipment, and container.Products picked may or may not be sorted during pick.Executing pick using integration with external material handling equipment.Pick batches created can be sent to external systems such as pick to light or othermaterial handling equipment. Warehouse has the visibility to whether batch is sentto material handling equipment or not. Warehouse can re-send the data to thematerial handling equipment, if required.Multiple-Step ExecutionPicking a batch can include multiple steps. The application can track all steps forexecuting a batch. Different steps include:1. Preparation of picking cart (placing empty containers or totes in a cart)2. Picking of items to a cart3. Packing containers in a cart4. Closing containers"
Productivity Management,"The productivity management enables you to model warehouse activities andmeasure productivity of the workers performing their activities.Activities are of different kinds. Based on the nature of each activity, differentvariables are captured to measure productivity. For example, the number of casesmoved and number of locations visited. For each variable or dimension, a SAM(standard allowable minutes) is associated. The total minutes that may be creditedfor each task is a function of the variables and the SAM associated with them. Awarehouse analyzes the time involved in doing each small part of an activity todefine the SAM for each dimension.The variables are a characteristic of a task type. Some task types require only a fewof the variables. For example, the variable ""number of locations visited"" isapplicable only to picking or replenishment tasks and not applicable to packing ormanifesting process.The application enables you to configure a list of variables that are applicable to aspecific activity and define SAM to each variable in an activity. SAM is definedagainst a task type for determining the efficiency of a user. For example, awarehouse allows defined minutes to be at a location, time to pick a case and thetime taken if aisles are being traversed.The application issues time credits to users based on the actual tasks performedand SAM defined for each activity. This information enables you to perform thefollowing worker-based activities:Identify labor efficiency of each user Compare labor efficiency between users Measure productivity associated with an activity and use this information torefine SAM Support activity based compensation Get daily feedback on performance relative to goals"
Deriving Labor Standards,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the ability to automaticallyderive labor standards based on the historical data of tasks or activities performedby warehouse users over a period of time. Labor standards are derived based onthe following algorithm: For selected users, the set of tasks completed by each user in a shift, trip, or aday are grouped as samples. For every sample, collect the following metrics:– Time spent by the user to complete the task (""time"").– Number of tasks completed by the user in the given period of time(""numTasks"").– Distance covered by the user (""distance"").– Number of locations visited by the user (""numLocs"").– Weight borne by the user (""weight"").– Amount of time to credit to the user (""creditedTime"").You can collect these metrics for a user for various samples as illustrated inthe following table.Assuming that the labor standards for a user are constant over a period oftime, the user is given full credit at the start time. Therefore, credited time forthe user is the same as the time taken by the user to complete the task.The credited time for each user sample is calculated according to the followingexpressions:C1 = SN.N1 + SD.D1 + SNL.NL1 + SW.W1C2 = SN.N2 + SD.D2 + SNL.NL2 + SW.W2C3 = SN.N3 + SD.D3 + SNL.NL3 + SW.W3where:SN = Allowed minutes per taskSD = Allowed minutes per unit distanceSNL = Allowed minutes per locationSW = Allowed minutes per unit weightC1 = Credited time for the first sampleC2 = Credited time for the second sampleC3 = Credited time for the third sampleThe linear system of equations above is solved for SN, SD, SNL, and SW in such away that the error (Ti – Ci)2 is minimum.Ability to Set Standards for the Selected UsersLabor standards are derived by setting standards for given set of users. Whenderiving labor standards, you can set a user to be X % efficient based on the datacollated for a user. In this case, the credited time for each sample is equal to(X/100) *T, where 'T' is the actual time taken to complete a task."
Consigned Inventory,"Consigned Inventory is a concept in which vendors own inventory for enterprises.The basic premise of consigned inventory is to delay the transfer of ownership andother transactions until the last point in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation.This reduces the cost of carrying the inventory and the lead time.The inventory organizations participating in consigned inventory are calledconsumable inventory organizations and consuming inventory organizations. Aconsuming inventory organization can choose a list of consumable inventoryorganizations to participate with.Based on the rules configured during execution in the warehouse, the inventoryget transferred from the consumable inventory organization to the consuminginventory organization.The catalog organization can be different between inventory organizations, thus thesame product can be modeled as different items in different catalogs. In such asituation, the system uses GlobalItemID (GTIN) to reference to these items."
Reverse Logistics,"Reverse Logistics is the process of handling return of products from a consumer ora retailer to a manufacturer through the use of the supply chain. Reverse Logisticsalso encompasses recycling of packaging and containers, reconditioning orrefurbishing of products and disposition of obsolete goods.Reverse logistics is one of the least focused areas for many companies. However,the ability to recuperate assets and revenue in the supply chain is causing a refocusin this area. There is a lack of understanding of what is being returned and why.The strategies followed in reverse logistics are disparate due to the type of SKUsbeing handled. For example, an online consumable retailer and an electronicsretailer.The Sterling Warehouse Management System Reverse Logistics providescomprehensive capabilities to manage ""end-to-end"" process of reverse logistics forall types of companies including retailers, manufacturers and third party reverselogistics providers. The reverse logistics process covers all aspects like creating areturn authorization, disposition of the product and the inventory returned isrestocked, returned to vendor or scrapped.The Sterling Warehouse Management System breaks up a return into individualSKUs along with their disposition. Visibility provided to the disposition in thereturns department allows for aggregation and routing of inventory to therespective areas. Routing in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is amulti-step process that incorporates requirements like refurbishment andrepackaging before an inventory is restocked. The additional fields inventoryattributes recorded include reason code, lot number, revision numbers and serialnumber.The granular visibility provided through recording of the information allowstracking of inventory from the time of receipt and through the multi-stepdisposition process before an item is putaway to the appropriate area. Audit trail isalso provided to track activities performed at a granular level, which includesreturn number, item, reason codes, disposition, inventory attributes and user.Many companies are unaware of the amount of inventory tied up in the return andrepair process. High-value products and parts may sit in technicians' vans orinspection centers for weeks before they are sent for repair or returned to stock.Often these parts require no repair and could immediately be resold to anothercustomer. The Sterling Warehouse Management System Reverse Logistics enablescompanies to effectively track items throughout the return and repair process andautomates the procedures that return items to stock. Real-time status updates fromservice and repair organizations enable your company to truly leverage the reverselogistics cycle as a source of supply."
Receipt,"A Return Authorization (RA) can be either created on IBM Sterling ReverseLogistics or downloaded from external host systems. There are situations wheninventory is returned due to a customer refusal or without using the properchannels. The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows to create blindreturns.Pre-ReceiptThe common practice is to temporarily stage packages that are returned for laterprocessing. These packages may be putaway to specified areas to be retrieved laterfor inspection.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows for receipt at the number ofpackages level. A package, if necessary, is assigned an individual case or palletwith LPN label to facilitate retrieval and visibility. Business process configurationallows for a putaway request to be automatically initiated.Return ReceiptA return in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is received based on theinformation that is available on the package or an item. SKU-level attributes alsoinfluence the method of receipt.Receipt on the Sterling Warehouse Management System is completed throughconsoles. A RA worksheet can be printed for paper-based warehouses. A userscanning or entering either the return number, serial number, or container idinitiates a receipt of the return. Capturing serial numbers are mandatory forserialized items and verification can be performed using extensibility against theiroriginal shipments. The Sterling Warehouse Management System also allows forintegration with external systems to validated serial number. A case or pallet withLPN associated during the receipt process allows for tracking and movement ofinventory. Inventory is tracked at the returns receipt location. In addition, otherinventory attributes such as lot number, revision number are recorded, if necessary.Business process configuration in the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemallows definition of the steps to be followed in a warehouse. The status of RAindicates the activity being performed or completed on the RA."
Disposition,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides visibility to RAs that arepending disposition. A user issues a move request to retrieve RAs to continue withthe inspection process. All tasks are created and monitored by Task Management.The Sterling Warehouse Management System completes product disposition byassociating a reason code and disposition code to the inventory. It also supportsmulti-step disposition for a SKU. For example, an item may require repairing,packaging and labeling before restocking. The Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem business process configuration allows for status tracking at each of thesesteps.The Sterling Warehouse Management System VAS process is used to generate workorders for tracking the repair process. A work order can span across multiple RAs.The Sterling Warehouse Management System outbound process allows for transferor repair orders to an external vendor. Transfer orders are used when products arereturned to a vendor."
Return Receipt Putaway,"The completion of the disposition process initiates the putaway of product. Theputaway process can be automated through a move request or manually requested.During putaway, the Sterling Warehouse Management System considers thepreferences setup at an item and location level. For more information aboutconstraints and preferences, see the topic, Putaway. This is carried out throughRadio Frequency (RF) Mobile Terminal, batch sheet or by interfacing with MHE.The task management of the Sterling Warehouse Management System controls thetask execution."
Close Return Receipt,"The closure of a return receipt is based on business rules that are specified for awarehouse. Receipts may be closed either automatically on expected quantity beingreceived, as an end-of-day process, or when putaway process is complete. Closurecan also be initiated manually from the console.The closure of a return receipt may be communicated to external systems. Theclosure of an return is initiated by external systems."
Receipt Visibility,"Visibility to returns is provided through a console. The console is divided intosearch through the return as they are created, released and then received in awarehouse. This section refers to visibility provided to the receipt of a return in awarehouse. For more information about visibility provided for returns and itsreleases before receipt, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation ReverseLogistics User Guide.The combinations of attributes used to search for a return receipt are betterillustrated through use cases or examples, which include: View all returns received from a buyer in the last 30 daysCriteria used includes buyer, status and receipt date range View all returns where inspection is complete and for a particular dispositionCriteria used include disposition code and check 'Inspection Completed' View if a particular serial number was returnedCriteria used include serial number View the return associated with a particular LPNCriteria used include Case ID or Pallet ID"
Using Value-Added Services,"Value-Added Services (VAS) are performed to meet customer demands. They canbe activities performed on a product before the product is delivered to thecustomer, or a provided service that is performed at the customer site.Activities can be performed at all types of facilities including manufacturingfacilities and flow-through or distribution centers. Some examples of VAS done atthe vendor site are:A vendor applies a license plate number (LPN) label on a carton based on themanufacturer's specification. A manufacturer applies price ticket or SKU labels based on the requirements of aretailer. A warehouse builds a pallet using customer requirements. A warehouse applies security tags on a class of items before shipping to certainretailers. A warehouse assembles components and builds a kit before shipping.Provided services are usually purchased by the customer for an additional fee.Some examples of activities that are offered as a provided service are: Installing a customer's home theater system. Providing maintenance to a furnace as part of a service contract.Installing software on a new computer, and configuring the computer to work on ahome network.Some examples of how value added services are used within the manufacturing,vendor, or shipping facilities are: VAS for stocking — a facility performs the VAS operations for stockingperiodically on the basis of expected demand for a product. For example, awarehouse ships pens, pencils and erasers separately. In addition, thatwarehouse may also ship a student package, which consists of 2 pens, 2 pencilsand an eraser. VAS for a customer — this type of VAS operation is performed to meet specificcustomer requirements, such as special ticketing or security tagging. The SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation allows the customization of inventory for abuyer at a node and ensures allocation to that customer. This scenario is referredto as made-to-customer, or buyer compliance. The customer usually makesrepeated purchases of these specialized items. This type of VAS is performed ina warehouse based on the demand forecast to reduce order cycle time. VAS for an order — this is applicable when:– A customer selects a customization when ordering an item, like monogam ona shirt. The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation creates a work orderto perform these services in a warehouse and ensures that inventory isallocated only to that order. This is also referred to as made-to-order.– A customer orders a dynamic physical kit and selects the requiredcomponents for that item. The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation.creates a work order to assemble the kit and ensures that the inventory of theassembled unit is allocated only to that order. This is also referred to as Builtto Order, or made-to-order.– Inbound shipments that require packaging. Parts received that requirepackaging to a specified unit of measure. Breaking kits or Dekitting — this is performed on kits in inventory that are notrequired anymore. For example, inventory leftover from a seasonal promotionmay be dekitted and the components can be used in other kits or soldindividually. Unit of Measure (UOM) Conversions — a warehouse may create a work orderto convert inventory from one UOM to another. For example, a warehouse maytrack inventory of screws individually as well as in packs of 50. A work order iscreated to convert single inventory units to packs of 50. Gift Wrap Services — a ship node may offer gift wrap services on items that areeligible for gift wrap. This flag is enabled for a node during Participant Setupfor Sourcing/Scheduling Node Attributes."
Postponing Item Creation,"One approach to providing Value-Added Services at the warehouse or otherfacility is to delay customization processes until an order is received. This isreferred to as 'postponement'. The warehouse stores generic product awaiting thecustomer demand to customize the product. After receiving an order, additionalservices are performed on the generic inventory to convert the generic inventoryinto customer requested specific inventory. This increases the order cycle timewhile reducing the risk of unusable inventory. An example of a postponementprocess is shown in the following figure.In the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, value-added services areexecuted by creating a work order. A work order is initiated automatically based on a demand, or manually by a user. The Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation manages the execution of a work order through retrieval of inventoryto the VAS department, recording of completion towards the final inventory, andputaway of the product to appropriate departments."
Work Order Creation,"A work order in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation captures theactivity required to perform a service. A work order is created in the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation by one of the following methods: Manual creation - A user initiates a request using the Work Order Console forrepackaging, UOM conversions, labeling, or dekitting. Automatic creation based on Inventory levels - A request is issued by theinventory monitor in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uponminimum or maximum levels being reached for a SKU. Automatic creation based on an order - A request issued by a sales order for anitem on the order. This typically occurs for made-to-order or made-to-customeritems.When a work order is created, it consists of one or more of the following types ofservices: Kitting Service - Assembling components for a kit item Dekitting Service - Disassembling a kit item. This may be done to acquire anindividual component to complete another order. Compliance Service - Value-added services that should be performed to supplyan item to a specific buyer for made-to-customer orders. Inventory Change - Converting inventory from one UOM to another. Provided Service - Service executed at a customer site. Delivery Service - Service executed for product delivery to the customer site.One or more services can be included in a work order, and have a sequencenumber assigned which indicates the order in which they should be performed.Each service can contain one or more service activities, which specifies the categoryof activity, such as Assemble Components, Apply Logos, or Pack Components.Provided Services are not combined with other services."
Work Order Hold Type,The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the ability to put workorders on multiple types of hold and manage them. An extensive search capabilityinto work orders that are put on hold is provided. Visibility into a detailed historyof all holds that were ever put on a work order is provided.
Work Order Execution,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows a warehouse to select a groupof work orders based on the work order attributes and release them for execution.A work order may have one or more activities representing each step of physicalwork to be completed in a warehouse. For example, a work order for cell phoneassembly involves placing of components into a unit box, actually assembly ofcomponents, frequency programming and testing.The Sterling Warehouse Management System assigns specific VAS stations to eachactivity in the work order where VAS is performed based on the product. A cellphone assembly process differs from that of a radio assembly.The Sterling Warehouse Management System retrieval algorithms are used torelease the work order. Partial allocation of a work order is also permitted awaitingcomplete release at a later date or time. The algorithm used determines the optimalretrieval locations based on the quantities requested and the closeness to the VASstation. Inventory is retrieved to the VAS station. Components are retrieved usingRadio Frequency (RF) Mobile Terminal, batch sheets or by integrating with MHE.The Sterling Warehouse Management System triggers replenishment tasks for theforward pick locations, considering the demand placed during the VAS retrievalprocess and the minimum levels for an SKU at the location.The Sterling Warehouse Management System Task Management creates andmanages all the tasks related to VAS component retrieval. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System uniquely tracks inventory that has been allocated to a workorder. This allows complete visibility and control over the execution or cancellationof a work order or its tasks."
Work Order Activity Confirmation,"A user confirms activities on a work order as per the BOM. The confirmation is amultiple step or a single step process. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemallows service items to be associated with a work order. Each service itemrepresents activities to be performed for the service. The work order confirmationis done either at an activity level or at the complete work order level. For example,first retrieve the boxes and the individual phones to place them in boxes.Frequency programming is done as a second step by a different group of users.The Sterling Warehouse Management System displays all instructions (text andgraphics) for the activity to be performed on the work order.A case or a pallet LPN can be associated with the confirmation of an activity. Thisallows movement of product from one VAS station to another for subsequentactivity. New serial numbers can be associated to the product during confirmation.Labels can be generated and applied to the product as required during the VASoperation.Inventory is created for the parent SKU in the activity location. If a work order hascomponents, the component inventory is consumed.The work order status indicates the pending activity. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System productivity tracks information related to work order at theactivity completion level."
Putaway,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System putaway algorithms are initiatedeither automatically upon work order completion or manually by the VASdepartment.For work orders that are related to a sales order, putaway is performed to theappropriate packing or shipping area. For SKUs that are for future orders in a""Made to Order,"" are putaway to storage area for later retrieval.For a build-to-stock work order, putaway is suggested to the appropriate storageareas."
Visibility,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides work order visibility at agranular level. A work order consists of parent SKU, component SKUs and otherattributes. The combinations of these attributes are illustrated through thefollowing use cases and examples: View the status of all dekitting work orders for a particular shipmentCriteria used include node, enterprise, and service item group. View the status of the special ticketing work order for a case or palletCriteria used include node, enterprise, case or pallet LPN and service itemgroup. View all work orders awaiting release and due to start later todayCriteria used include node, enterprise, status range and start no earlier than dateand/or time View all open work orders that have 'cut paper' activity pending at VAS stationoneCriteria used include node, enterprise, activity code and location"
Resource Planning,"The Resource Planning tool provides warehouses the ability to plan for expectedworkload and determine the number of resources required to complete the activity.Having visibility to expected resources enables a warehouse to accurately plan forovertime, temporary staffing, and so forth, thus optimizing resource costs.The productivity of a warehouse is measured in terms of its efficiency, resources,and so forth. Planning aids warehouses in managing demands for their fulfillmentactivities. Appropriate outbound planning leads to significant cost saving as thewarehouse has visibility to resource requirements well ahead of time. Thewarehouse can plan for on-hand shipments or for future demands predicted basedon the historical data.The planning module estimates resource requirements for all the activitiesperformed in a warehouse such as: Replenishment Picking Packing Manifesting ShippingThe factors that affect planning are: The warehouse calendar, user calendars, equipment maintenance calendars Number of pack stations Number of docks Number of forklifts Number of staging locationsDepending on the available resources and constraints, you can yield results suchas: The demand that can be satisfied with the available resources The limiting factorsOnce the constraints are revealed, you can plan to see if you can do the followingto fulfill the demand: Extend the shift hours Increase the count of resources Shuffle demands based on the requested ship dates to days that have optimumcapacity"
Managing Capacity,"The demand requests such as shipment, workorder, and count request requireresources from multiple resource pools to varying extents are required.Based on the standard available capacity, you can verify if demands can befulfilled with the available capacity. When the capacity falls short, the resourcesassigned to other pools may be pulled into this pool to cover its shortage."
Estimating Work,"To fulfill demand requests such as shipment, workorders, and count request,resources from multiple resource pools are required. The resource planning ofSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can be used to determine the variousactivities to be completed in order to fulfill the demand requests. Based on thelabor standards defined, the time required for each activity can also be estimated.Thus, the capacity required against each resource pool is estimated for each day."
How do you call an API from custom code having the template file name with two periods in IBM Sterling Order Management?,"Template file with name create.Order.xml is not working.In Sterling OMS/CPQ v9.4, there has been a white list validation added for template names because template names can be passed by external touch points like custom code, REST APIs etc. The default white list does not allow period (.) in the name, however the file type can be xml.It can be allowed to use characters selectively in template file name by specifying a suitable regular expression in the yfs property - ""templatemanager.file.pattern"".For example:If below entry is made in customer_overrides.properties file then ""."" will also be allowed in the template file name.yfs.templatemanager.file.pattern=(?:\\w|.|\\/)+(?:.xml)?NOTE: You should come up with a regular expression of your own to suit their needs. The default regex value is ""(?:\\w|\\/)+(?:.xml)?"". It is always better to stick to a format which is used by out of the Box templates so that such issues don't disturb the customization while upgrading to a higher version."
What's the function of Release Wave on Wave Console?,"When the user press the ""Release"" button on Wave console, The requestWaveRelease API is called, which registers a request to release a wave for the specified wave. Wave attributes like ReleaseNoEalier Than and ReleaseNoLaterThan can be modified using this API. Before registering a request the requestWaveRelease API checks if wave can be processed by Assign Pick Locations(wave release). If the wave can't be processed by the transaction, the error WMS00159 -Wave can't be processed is thrown.So the wave is not released just by press ""Release"" button on Wave Console, executing releaseWave API or Release_Wave agent is required."
How to generate Putaway tasks when same Item is received having multiple receipts at the same Receiving location in IBM Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Suite?,"The receipt number is blanked out. when you receive multiple Items with different receipts as loose inventory in a single location.To resolve:Receive inventory in LPN, where the receipt number is maintained.ORAvoid receiving multiple receipts in a single location and disable the configuration which allows mixing of receipts."
What Is Opportunity Management?,"An opportunity is a container of one or more quotes that are associated with asingle sales opportunity. For example, a Field Sales Representative may see anopportunity to sell laptop computers and desktop computers to a specificcustomer. The Field Sales Representative generates one or more quotes, which arethen presented to the customer. For example:Quote A: Buy 5 laptop computers and 5 desktop computers for a total cost of$4,000.00. Quote B: Buy 4 laptop computers and 6 desktop computers for a total cost of$3,500.00. Quote C: Buy 2 laptop computers and 8 desktop computers for a total cost of$3,000.00.The customer can negotiate the terms of any of these quotes with the Field SalesRepresentative. However, the customer can accept only one quote, therebyabandoning all other quotes associated with the sales opportunity. If the customeraccepts a quote, an order is created from that quote, all associated quotes areabandoned, and the opportunity is won. If the customer does not want to negotiateon any of the quotes or the quotes expire, the quotes are abandoned and theopportunity is lost.For additional information about creating and managing opportunities, refer toSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Setting Up Quotes in Distributed OrderManagement."
Introduction to Order Promising,"In the supply chain industry, the products or services requested by means of anorder must be checked for availability, promised, scheduled for shipment ordelivery, and then released (shipped or delivered).As a part of its Order Promising functionality, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation provides configurable rules that can be used for controlling theselection of nodes and shipping dates for both products and services. To help youunderstand the capabilities of these Order Promising features, this chapterdescribes the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation concepts associated withpromising functions and provides information about the required setup to achieveyour business objectives.Order promising functionality is provided for products being shipped as well asservice requests (delivery and provided services). For more detailed informationabout these specific promising features, see “Promising for Products BeingShipped” on page 139 or “Promising Service Requests” on page 182.To understand how all of this is accomplished in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation, you should first be familiar with the following common termsassociated with order promising:NodeA node is a physical location to or from where a product is shipped, returned, ordelivered.When a node is specified on an order line, it indicates the intent to fulfill the orderline from that node. If the node is a firm predefined node, order promisingfunctionality ensures that the order line is fulfilled from only this node.However, certain business requirements may require inventory to be reserved foran order as soon as it is created. This inventory reservation is achieved byproviding the ship node on the order line where inventory is reserved. The nodespecified for reservation may not be the most optimal node to fulfill the order. Inthis scenario, the node can be marked as a non-firm node. When promising theorder, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation scheduling functionality tries tofind alternate nodes where inventory may be available based upon the sourcingsetup.By default, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation treats each node suppliedon the order line as a firm node unless otherwise stated.Distribution GroupA distribution group (referred to as distribution rule in previous releases) is a setof nodes or organizations defined for distributing products or services.Availability InquiryMost systems provide inventory availability inquiry and service availabilityfunctions separately. Typically, you have to inquire within the inventory module tofind product availability. A separate capacity module, if available for services, canbe inquired for capacity availability. If more complex inquiry functions are requiredthat had to consider ship-to locations or multiple product availability with someconstraints, such as must ship together, you have to create a quote on the systembefore you can query the availability.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, however, has taken a differentapproach and it provides an API to inquire about the availability of multipleproducts AND services in a single inquiry function without having to create apersisted document on the system. This API considers all the inter-dependenciesbetween the multiple lines when suggesting your possible sourcing options. Thesame inquiry function is also available if you have created an order in the system.Available to Promise RulesAvailable to Promise (ATP) rules help to set up a monitoring system for trackinginventory item availability and raise specific actions when the inventory fallsbelow a specified minimum level. The availability of an item can be tracked on thecurrent day, subsequent days within the ATP time frame, and subsequent daysoutside the ATP time frame. This enables you to more accurately order supplies tomeet current and future demand.SchedulingScheduling is the process of: Determining the shipping node or supplier for product fulfillment or the serviceprovider for service fulfillment. This logical process step is referred to as""Sourcing"". Determining the dates when the product or service is shipped or delivered. Reserving the inventory at the shipping location for the shipment date.However, if inventory is already reserved for a product line scheduling does notattempt to recheck inventory.Note that the scheduling function requires an order document.Scheduling RuleScheduling rules control common scheduling parameters such as: When an order should be scheduled How many days ahead should product availability be checked (if you arepromising against future inventory) What type of optimization should be used for schedulingFor example, you can optimize based on date so that Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation chooses a shipping node that can deliver on the earliestdate. You could also optimize based on the number of shipments; SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation minimizes the total number of shipmentsrequired even though it may end up getting delivered at a later date. Ship complete order or ship complete line parameters.Sourcing RulesSourcing rules control which node, external organization, or group of nodes shouldbe considered for sourcing a product based on the product, item classifications,ship-to region, and other parameters.NotificationNotification is the process of notifying the shipping node, vendor, or serviceprovider when fulfilling the order request. Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation creates several different documents for this notification process.Delivering NodeA delivering node is the location where a product is being delivered using a lastmile service."
Promising for Products Being Shipped,"As part of its promising functions, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides the following capabilities: Inquiries about product availability. The product availability inquiry functiontakes into consideration all the business rules associated with the promisingfunction and provides one or more options for sourcing and possible shipmentdates. Using the user interface, you can inquire about product availability for aspecific order. Using the promising API (findInventory ()), which does notrequire a pre-existing order, you can inquire about product availability for a setof items. Scheduling an order or order line. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides APIs and transactions to schedule an order for shipping at anappropriate time. The scheduling function determines the node and expectedshipment date and schedules a shipment against the same. The schedulingfunction also reserves the inventory at the shipping node for the expectedshipment date. Creation of notifications and chained documents to notify the nodes or suppliersat the appropriate time.Finding Product AvailabilityThis section discusses concepts associated with finding product availability.Available to Promise RulesAvailable to Promise (ATP) rules enable you to determine the availability of anitem for current and future demand. This determination makes the most efficientuse of inventory so that items are not set aside for future orders when they couldbe used to fulfill more immediate demands. The availability of an item is based oncurrent and future supply, lead time, and ATP configuration. The lead time is theamount of time it takes your supplier (distribution center or drop-ship supplier) topurchase an item for shipping. The processing time covers the time it takes for anitem to be received by a supplier and made ready for shipment (inboundprocessing) as well as shipping it from the warehouse (outbound processing).ATP rules enable you to effectively manage orders for items. Parameters can be setfor the amount of time an item is available for current and future orders. With a First Expiration First Out (FEFO) inventory management system, perishable itemscan be sold and shipped well before their expiration dates, ensuring first expiredinventory is consumed first.Inventory Availability Safety FactorThe inventory availability safety factor defines a fixed quantity or percentage thatis excluded from inventory availability for various purposes. Application of theinventory availability safety factor is controlled at the scheduling rule, supply type,and node type.Promising Onhand InventoryWhen dealing with store availability in a scenario where availability is sharedbetween online consumers and in-store customers, the actual availability of aproduct at any given time may not be accurate, due to misplaced items, items inshopping carts, or items on reserve. This may lead to over-promising to onlineconsumers.Using the inventory availability safety factor, stores can define the quantity orpercentage of inventory, by item or inventory supply type, to be excluded from theinventory availability that is visible to online consumers.Promising Future InventoryFuture inventory is supply that is expected to arrive at a supplier, but is not yet onhand. Future inventory that is generated by a purchase order can be used by anenterprise to promise against new and existing orders. However, in some cases, notall future inventory can be considered to be completely reliable. For example, if anenterprise has just placed a purchase order to one of its suppliers, it's possible thatthe order may become backordered. Therefore, the enterprise may only want toconsider 40% of the future supply created by the purchase order for orderpromising. If the supply has been shipped and is in transit, the enterprise can bemore confident that the supply is received in a timely manner. Therefore, theenterprise can safely promise up to 95% of the in transit supply.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides for this flexibility. Eachenterprise can define the percentage of each supply type that can be used topromise demand.Unplanned InventoryThe unplanned inventory is the inventory that is assumed to be available based onthe lead time of an item. For example, if there is an order inquiry for 10 quantitiesof item1 with the lead time of 10 days, and there are only 7 quantities of item1 inonhand inventory. When unplanned inventory is considered, the order can bescheduled against the following inventory:Onhand Inventory = Available on current date for 7 quantitiesUnplanned Inventory = Available on current date + 10 days (lead time) for 3quantitiesMinimum Ship-By DateWhen dealing with time-sensitive items, customers may have different preferenceson the life span of their products after they are shipped. For example, a regular retailer may request an item with a remaining life span of 240 days, whereas adiscount retailer may request the same item with a life span of 120 days, for lesscost.You can specify a minimum ship-by date on an order line during order creation.The order creation process takes into consideration the preferred remaining lifespan of a time-sensitive item beyond its ship date. The minimum ship-by date isthe preferred ship-by date in addition to the requested remaining life of theproduct.During the promising and scheduling processes for a time-sensitive item, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation ensures that the available quantity is promisedonly when the minimum ship-by date on the order line falls before or on the sameday as the ship-by date of the inventory supply (expiration date).This implies that to fulfill this order, the quantity of Item1 promised must have aremaining life span of 20 days at the time of shipment.Since Supply1 would expire 14 days after shipment, this inventory would not beconsidered for promising. In contrast, Supply2 would expire 29 days aftershipment, and thus meets the specified criteria.SourcingSourcing is the process of determining from which node or supplier a productshould be shipped.In the most simplistic scenarios when you have just a single distribution center,you already know the shipping node. In such cases you can pre-specify theshipping node in the inquiry function or specify it on the order line. If this node isa firm pre-defined node, an order line is only sourced from that ship node. Youneed not do any sourcing configuration in this case.However, if the node is not a firm pre-defined node, the remaining sourcing setupis used. If the node specified on the line is not a firm node or in more complexsituations, you may have multiple nodes and suppliers from which you source theproducts.The requirements for selection of the correct shipping location may be based on: What product is being shipped. Ship to location - typically you would want to ship out of the closest shippinglocation but you still need to ensure that geopolitical requirements are met. For example, if shipping to El Paso, Texas you may want to ship the product from adistribution center located in the United States even though a Mexicandistribution center is closer to El Paso. Product availability at different locations. A warehouse may or may not haveinventory for a given item. However, a manufacturer may want to alwaysassume that any demand can be fulfilled using existing raw material at thenode. To achieve this, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can beconfigured to never perform inventory checks on schedule and release forcertain items, at any node. You can enable this functionality at the item level. Total number of shipments that are required to complete the request. This, insome ways, reflects the transportation and handling costs associated with theentire shipment. If an order is placed for 3 items and one of your nodes carriesall three and another node carries only 2 them, you may want to ship from thenode carrying all 3 items in just one shipment compared to two shipments in theother case. Prioritization of nodes. You may want to first ship out of your own locationsand then use drop-ship suppliers when no product is available in your ownnodes. Customer specified constraints such as ship together dependencies and fillquantities being met from the selected node. Ability to perform services for a work order. This could include kitting anddekitting services, and ability to supply services for buyer compliance. Ability to perform gift wrapping services. A ship node may or may not offer giftwrapping as a fulfillment option for an item. You can enable this functionality atthe node attribute level. A customizable order sourcing classification. For example, an enterprise maywant to use a customer attribute as a sourcing parameter. The order sourcingclassification enables this flexibility.The following sections discuss the configuration required to achieve theserequirements. When making sourcing and date decisions, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation uses the configuration setup for the: Enterprise on the order. Exceptions to this rule are noted in individual cases. Primary Enterprise of the Organization code passed in on-the-fly inquiry APIs.Sourcing Configuration: When making sourcing decisions for your products,think about how you would configure the following parameters. This helps you todefine your preliminary product sourcing configuration.1. Are sourcing rules defined?Sourcing rules are defined by the Enterprise. You can use this parameter tospecify if the Enterprise defines sourcing rules at all. If you ship only from thedistribution centers owned by the Enterprise and the Enterprise has only a fewdistribution centers, you may not need to do any complex sourcing setups. Ifyou set this parameter as ""No"", Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationsources the product from any of the nodes owned by the Enterprise. It uses theoptimization logic to pick the appropriate node based on distance and otherparameters.Note: This functionality has changed from previous releases (5.0 and earlier).In earlier releases, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation was looking forthe setup as defined by the Seller organization on the order. There is nobackward compatibility provided for this and you need to reconfigure yoursourcing rules to achieve the desired functionality 2. Is inventory information available to the system?This parameter is setup for all organizations that can own inventory. Thisparameter specifies whether or not an organization makes inventoryinformation available to Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation.Information can be made available either through the Sterling Global InventoryVisibility application or through a real-time interface.If you can make inventory information available to the system, you should setthis parameter to 'Yes'. This typically results in better sourcing decisions. If suchinformation is not available, you must set this to 'No'.Also note that apart from this parameter, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation uses inventory availability as one of the constraints only if the: Seller organization on the order publishes inventory information (thisparameter is set to 'Yes') Document type of the order is set to 'read inventory for scheduling' Document type of the order is set to 'update inventory for sellerorganization'If any of the above is not true, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationassumes that an inventory check does not have to be performed at all andthe sourcing process does not consider inventory as one of the determiningfactors. However, other factors such as distance and node priorities are stillconsidered for ship node selection.3. Is inventory kept externally?This parameter is relevant only if the above parameter ""Is Inventoryinformation available to the system"" is set to ""Yes"". This parameter specifies ifinventory information for the organization is maintained within the SterlingGlobal Inventory Visibility application or is made available through a real-timeinterface.A single distribution group can specify: Nodes for which inventory is kept within the Sterling Global InventoryVisibility application. Organizations keeping inventory externallyWhen checking for inventory, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationuses this parameter to determine the inventory store and if kept externally,makes a call out to get the product availability.4. Default distribution node group?This parameter defines the default set of nodes or suppliers to consider forsourcing when Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation does not find amatching sourcing rule. Sourcing rule setup is discussed in “Sourcing Rules” onpage 144. Note that this parameter is only relevant for the Enterprise setting upthe sourcing rules.Distribution Groups: A distribution group is a defined a set of nodes or externalorganizations. You can then associate the defined distribution group with asourcing rule. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation considers all the nodesor organizations that are part of this group and optimizes on various factors formaking the node selection. A priority number can also be specified for each nodeor organization. This priority number is used for node selection based on theoptimization mode being used for scheduling. For more information aboutscheduling based on optimization, see “Scheduling Rules” on page 151.For example, in Figure 29, multiple distribution node groups such as ""East Coast"",""Central"", and so forth, are depicted. Notice that a single node can be part ofmultiple node groups at the same time.Also, note that it is not always necessary to create distribution groups because ofproximity of shipping locations. You may create groups to differentiate betweenyour own nodes and external suppliers and then use the sourcing rule'ssequencing feature to first try and source from your own nodes. If not enoughinventory is found, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation looks into thesupplier nodes.Sourcing Rules: If you set the ""Sourcing rules defined"" parameter to ""No"", thesetup of sourcing rules is irrelevant for you and can be skipped completely.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation automatically considers all the nodesowned by the Enterprise as potential candidates for sourcing the product andselects the optimal node based on the rest of your configuration.This section discusses sourcing rule setup and how Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation uses this configuration.A sourcing rule can be created by specifying one or more of the following keyparameters: Item Classifications or Item ID Geographical region of the ship-to location or ship-to node Fulfillment type Seller organization Sourcing criteriaYou have the flexibility to leave any of the above parameters (except fulfillmenttype) as void in the sourcing rule and that implies that the sourcing rule isapplicable to all values of that parameter.For each sourcing rule, you can then specify a sequence of node or distributiongroup to be used for sourcing the product.Order Sourcing ClassificationSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the flexibility to configure acustom parameter that is high in the sourcing priority ladder. For example, anenterprise may be supplying products to a number of retail stores, and one ofthose retail stores does not want their products to come from a warehouse that isin a foreign country. This could be due to the complications that come withcrossing borders (duty, delays with merchandise check). It is possible, by specifyinga customer name or customer attribute such as the order sourcing classification, totake this restriction into account in the sourcing logic.Item Classifications or Item IDSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the flexibility to configuresourcing rules based on multiple item classifications to avoid extensive setupsrequired at each item level. At the same time, it also provides the flexibility tospecify this setup at an item level for special situations.One approach is Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation could take is to useonly a pre-defined ""classification"" such as product line for this setup. In differentsituations, you may want to create your own classifications and use them forsetting up sourcing rules. For example, in a process industry dealing with steel, theclassification could be the ""grade of steel, whereas for a retailer it could be""product line"".To provide this flexibility, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation enables youto pick your own item attributes that are used for setting up the sourcing rules.Your catalog organization (the Enterprise could be maintaining its own catalogs)can select the classifications that should be used for purposes of ""Productsourcing"". For example, your organization can choose to set up sourcing based ona product line classification. Another enterprise in the same installation couldchoose some other custom classification for sourcing.Geographical RegionSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the flexibility to createsourcing rules based on the region to which the product is being shipped. Anorganization can choose the Region Schema to be used for determining theshipping region. Every ship-to address is translated to a shipping region hierarchyin the Region Schema based on its postal code. This shipping region is used tolook up the correct sourcing rule. “Example 1: Sourcing Rules” on page 148 and“Example 2: Sourcing Rule Region Hierarchy” on page 149 below illustrate theusage of regions in sourcing rule determination. See “Regions and Region Schema”on page 182 for a complete understanding of this function.Procure for Shipment SetupWhen evaluating product availability, the system considers each sourcing ruledetail in the selected shipping sourcing rule. If the product is not available at thenode or distribution rule with lowest sequence, the procurement sourcing rule isconsidered, and evaluated in the order of the sequence specified. If all procurementdetails have been evaluated but inventory cannot be found, the next detail in theshipping sourcing rule is considered.Procurement sourcing rules are not supported for logical kit items.In some situations you may want to ship a product from a particular location evenwhen there is no product available at that location. For such situations, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation can automatically create a transfer or purchaseorder for the product when it is not available at the shipping location of choice. Todo so, the ""Procure for shipment"" flag must be set to ""Yes"".An example of a situation where you would want to do this is when you want toship a complete order out of a single node close to the final ship-to location butthe desired ship node does not stock all of the items or is just a cross-docklocation. You set this parameter to ""Yes"". Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation then sources the order to the desired ship node location and thencreates a transfer order or a procurement order from other locations to this locationto complete that particular order. These ""chained procurement orders"" act astransfer orders or could be purchase orders that are tied to the customer shippingorder. Figure 30 illustrates a typical setup for shipment procurement.This can be very effectively used for implementing ""merge in transit"" functionality.The merge location can act as the shipping node for the order. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation creates transfer movements to the merge location based onthis setup. Selection of the merge location itself can be driven out of thegeographical dimension of the sourcing rules.Apart from this being set to ""Yes"", the node in question should also be configuredto set the ""Procure for shipment allowed"" flag to ""Yes"".To effectively achieve the creation of transfer or procurement orders, the followingmust also be set up:Procure for ship"" sourcing rulesThese are sourcing rules set up by the procuring node. These rules are similar tothe other sourcing rules discussed here. You can define multiple sourcing ruleswith corresponding sequences, similar to shipping sourcing rules. Each sourcingdetail contains either a single node or a distribution rule (optimized based onnode availability of the selling node), which enables you to consider multiple nodes for procurement. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation looks intothe inventory of the node or nodes from where you want to procure items, andif available, creates a procurement order. The ""Requires chained orders"" flag must be set to ""Yes"" Transfer scheduleThough not mandatory, this schedule can be created to specify a transferschedule between any two nodes on a ""day-of-week"" basis. Transit time can alsobe specified. This setup is used for calculating expected dates and is discussed in“Calculating Expected Dates” on page 157.Note: When calling the inventory availability API, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation takes all of this information into account and suggestsdates considering that a procurement order would be created. However, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation does not actually create the procurementorder until you use the scheduling function to schedule an order.Fulfillment TypeAn Enterprise can define the list of valid values for fulfillment type and specify iton the order line. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses the sourcingrule associated with the fulfillment type to determine the correct sourcing rule. Ablank value can be specified for the fulfillment type on the order line, but it cannotbe blank in the sourcing rule. If it is blank on the order line, the enterprise on thedefault fulfillment type of the order is used to select a sourcing rule. SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation does an exact match between the value of theparameter in the sourcing rule and the fulfillment type on the order line. Unlikeother sourcing rule parameters, a blank value in this parameter does not signifythat it can be used for all fulfillment types.This control can be used to accommodate custom requirements where you need touse different sourcing locations based on parameters Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation either does not understand or does not provide control onin this release; such as customer, quantity of an order line, or order type. You cantranslate your requirements into different fulfillment types and thus get differentsourcing rules.Seller OrganizationSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the flexibility to source aproduct differently based on the Seller organization involved in the transaction.You may model your stores as different Seller organizations and may wantdifferent sourcing based on the store from where the product was sold.Sourcing Rule Determination: You can easily notice that you can createconflicting sets of sourcing rules by leaving some of the parameters void. SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation resolves such conflicts by using a priority orderfor the key parameters. The priority order Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation uses is:1. Seller Organization2. Order Sourcing Classification3. Item ID4. Primary Item Classification5. Secondary Item Classification6. Tertiary Item Classification7. Geographical Region of the ship-to locationFulfillment type is matched exactly with the order line parameter or inquiryparameter.If you specify just ""Item ID"" for one rule and ""Primary Item Classification"" foranother rule and both rules match the values for the product being sourced,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation chooses the rule specified for the ItemID over the one specified for Primary Item Classification. It also gives preference tothe rule where a value is specified for the parameter over the rule where the valueis left blank. ""Example 1: Sourcing Rules"" further explains this concept.Example 1: Sourcing RulesThis example describes a basic sourcing scenario. Your sourcing rule parametersare defined as described in Table 20.If you are sourcing an order line with its Item ID, Item Classification and ShippingLocation values of ITEM1, TV, and New York, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation uses rule #1. Even though rule #2 also meets the criteria, rule #1 ismore specific over the other rule. The Item ID parameter is given higher preferenceover the Primary Item Classification parameter.If you are sourcing an order line with its Item ID, Primary Item Classification,respectively, and Shipping Location values of ITEM1, TV, and Los Angeles-CA,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses rule #3. Even though rules #1, 2,and 4 also meet the order line criteria, rule #3 is given higher priority over theother rules because each of these rules have some parameters as blank (void) andrule #3 does not. The Item ID parameter is given higher preference over theGeographical Region parameter.If you are sourcing an order line with its Item ID, Primary Item Classification, andShipping Location values of ITEM1, TV, and San Francisco-California, respectively,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses rule #5. Even though rules #1, 2,3, and 4 also meet the order line criteria, rule #5 is given higher priority over theother rules because each of these rules have some parameters as blank (void)compared to rule #5. Rule #5 is given higher preference than rule #3 because theregion specified in rule #5 is more specific compared to rule #3's region.""Example 2: Sourcing Rule Region Hierarchy"" further illustrates the hierarchy fordetermining the sourcing rules with defined regions.Example 2: Sourcing Rule Region HierarchyWhen selecting a sourcing rule, the rule matching the lowest level region is givenhigher preference over any rule that has a higher-level region specified.A hierarchy of region is defined as:Assume that the sourcing rules are defined as follows: Use ""Node1"" for shipping to any address in New York Use ""Node2"" for shipping to any address in Downtown Manhattan.The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation node selection for the shippingaddress chooses Node2 when shipping to Downtown Manhattan and Node1 forany address in Manhattan other than Downtown Manhattan.Using Sequence of Sourcing TemplatesFor each sourcing rule, you can specify a sequence of sourcing templates to beused for sourcing the order line.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation tries to source the product from thehighest sequence (lowest number) sourcing template. When multiple choices areavailable to Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, node selection isoptimized based on settings in the scheduling rule associated with the order.Optimization settings are discussed in detail in “Scheduling Rules” on page 151.If there is no available product in the sourcing template specified in this sequence,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation tries to source from the next sequencedsourcing template.When Would You Want to Use Sequencing?In certain situations you may want to have more control of the optimization logicused by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation for sourcing.For example, you need to ship to a location in El Paso, Texas. You have multiplewarehouses in North America. You want to first look into United Stateswarehouses and only if there is no inventory available in the United Stateswarehouses would you want to look in the Mexican warehouses. If you specify allNorth American locations into the same sequence, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation optimizes on the distance between the ship-from and ship-to locations(this can also be controlled to optimize on other parameters) and that may result inshipment from a Mexican warehouse. Being able to control the sequence ofdistribution groups to consider enables you to handle such geopolitical situations.Figure 31 on page 150 illustrates this concept.Another reason to provide specific sequences is for system performance reasons.Suppose a shipment needs to be sent to a New York address. You have 30 to 40distribution centers spread across the country and you want to make the shipmentfrom the closest distribution center that has the product. You could group yourshipping nodes into 4 to 5 distribution node groups based on geographical regionssuch as east coast nodes, west coast nodes, central US, and southern US.For this particular situation you would set up the sequence so that Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation first tries to source from the East Coast nodes and thenthe subsequent regions. This is illustrated in Figure 32. Notice that the same nodecan be included as part of multiple groups.One obvious question in the above setup is why shouldn't you just specify a singlesequence and associate a distribution node group that includes all United Stateslocations? Since Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation already optimizes toselect the closest location, this requires less setup with the same results.The primary reason why you would want to set this up as multiple sequences is toprevent Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation from performing redundantinventory searches and thus obtain better response times from the promising functions. Since Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation optimizes the selectionbetween all the specified nodes, it needs to read inventory in all the specifiednodes before it makes a final selection. If all the United States locations were to bespecified, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation reads the inventory of everylocation before making the final selection. If you can create a smaller subset ofnodes to look into, it in all likelihood save you system resources and provide betterresponse times. The choice between the lesser setup and better performance ismainly based on how many locations you are searching. It is reasonable to put 5 to10 locations in a single sequence. Any more locations in a single sequence couldresult in some performance degradation.Priority of Nodes When Using Multiple SequencesSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation looks at each of the sequences set up inthe sourcing rule to source the product until its finds product availability. Thepriority of an individual node at any given time is calculated as the highestpriority of the node amongst all the groups in the sequence. If a node is explicitlymentioned as one of the sequences, priority is treated as 0 (highest).For each sourcing rule, you can also specify a sequence which enhances schedulingthat considers future inventory based on sourcing rule configuration. If preferredsubstitute is configured for an item, then that needs to be shipped before theonhand inventory. For example, consider:Sequence Number SequenceSequence 1 Source from Regional DCConsider future inventory that is coming inthe next 5 daysSubstitution allowedSequence 2 Source from Regional DCConsider future inventory that is coming inthe next 30 daysSubstitution allowedThe Onhand inventory is 5 and the Preferred substitute is 5 which would becoming in 2 days and 10 in 20 days.If Customer1 orders 5 items, then the preferred substitute is shipped to thecustomer as it is coming within 5 days.When Customer2 orders 5 more items, then the onhand inventory is shipped as thepreferred substitute now has 0.Now, when Customer3 orders 5 items, he gets them within 30 days as thepreferred substitute and onhand inventory now has 0.Therefore, these configurations prioritize selection of additional nodes and lookingat future inventory.Scheduling Rules: This section discusses the parameters related to the sourcing ofproducts only. There are other parameters defined as part of scheduling rules thatare used for date determination purposes which are discussed in “CalculatingExpected Dates” on page 157.Scheduling rules are set up at an Enterprise level. Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation uses the rule defined by the Enterprise of the order transaction. Whenusing an on-the-fly inquiry, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses therule defined by the primary Enterprise of the organization code making therequest.Use Geography?This parameter can be used to turn node prioritization on or off based on thedistance between the node and the ship-to location. If ""Use geography"" is set to""Yes"" and you are optimizing node selection based on ""Priority"", Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation calculates the node priority as:Weight factor for distance * distance in miles as calculated based on longitudeand latitude + Weight factor for priority * priority setup in the distributionnode group. If using multiple sequences, see ""Priority of Nodes When UsingMultiple Sequences"".This combined priority is used to select the node that has the lowest prioritynumber. The weight factors are also set up as part of the scheduling rules.If you want to give first preference to the node priority setup, you would want toset up the weight factor of ""Priority"" as 100,000 irrespective of the distance that isgiven the first preference. When the priorities of two nodes are the same, thedistance is the tiebreaker. If you want to give distance more importance, you set upthe weight factor for priority as 0 or another low number. You can work out theweight factors and priority numbers you want to use based on the fact that thedistance (in miles) calculation is done internally.Optimization TypeWhen multiple nodes and dates are available for sourcing, this parameter can beused to make sourcing selections based on: Priority of nodes Distance of nodes from the ship-to location Date when the delivery can be made Number of resultant shipments Cost-based schedulingThe optimization type that is required can be set as part of the scheduling rules.The following optimization types can be set: Priority - If this is set, node selection is based on the priority setup in thedistribution group and the distance from the node to the Ship-To location.Priority is calculated using Weight of node priority * Node priority + Weight ofdistance * Distance from the node to the ship-to location. Distance calculation isdone based on the longitude and latitude of the two locations, and is only a""straight-line"" distance. Distance calculation has an approximately 20% errormargin from the actual road distance in most scenarios. Distance of nodes from the Ship-To location - When optimizing a schedulingsolution, the schedule can take into consideration the node priority cost. Thepriority of the node is converted into schedule cost using the priority cost factor.The product of the node priority and the priority cost factor results in additionalcost for using that particular node. For example:Distribution Group Passed on Line DG1: N1 – Priority 1, N2 - Priority 10.Final leg shipping cost from N1 is $10, from N2 it is $2 (assuming no other costsare being used).The optimum solution is N2.After the node priority cost factor is enabled,Priority Cost Factor - $1Option1 - N1 - 1*$1+$10=$11Option2 - N2 - 10*$1+$2=$12The optimum solution is N1 as it has the lesser cost and a low priority of node. Date - Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation selects the node that canmake the earliest delivery of the product. Delivery date is calculated based onthe transit time calculated between the shipping and ship-to locations. For moreinformation about transit time calculation, see “Determining Transit Time” onpage 166. Number of shipments - Shipment date and node selection is done in a way thatit reduces the total number of shipments finally made. This is also accomplishedby consolidating the shipments against future inventory. As a result, theshipment might get delayed beyond what is informed to the customer. Toaddress this issue, you can configure maximum number of days (delay window)by which a shipment can be delayed.Figure 33 illustrates how the windows refer to the optimization date range,which is configured as 5 days. The items are available on various dates. Item1 isavailable on 2/3/06 and continues to be available until 2/15/06. Similarly, theItem2 is available on 2/6/06 and Item3 on 2/8/06 until 2/15/06. Item 4 isavailable only on 2/15/06. If the customer places an order for all the items, andhas agreed to wait for the shipment, the items are consolidated in one shipmentand is shipped on 2/15/06 which reduces the cost of multiple shipments. Thisapplies the rule of Date Range Optimization Logic. But if the customer wantsthe items to be shipped when they are available, the shipment optimization isconsidered and the customer is shipped items1 and 2 at the earliest date 2/6/06which falls within a single window.A Delay window can be specified at the item level to account for high ticketitems. This window can be set to 0 days which means that the product is neverdelayed. You can also choose not to delay shipments to be consolidated withfuture inventory since information (dates) about future inventory is often notaccurate. This ensures that onhand and procured inventory is shippedimmediately. Cost-based scheduling - Cost-based optimization enables the scheduling processto consider landed cost when determining a fulfillment option. Landed costconsists of the following costs:– Item Inventory Cost uses the average cost maintained in Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation to compute a unit cost of an item at a given node.– Handling Cost, both input and outbound handling costs, can be configuredper unit, per line, or per shipment. Inbound cost is considered whenprocurement is selected during scheduling, and is applied at the procure-tonode. Outbound handling cost is considered for outbound shipments and isapplied at the ship node.– Transfer Cost is considered when a procurement option is selected whenscheduling. Transfer cost can be configured per unit, per unit weight, per unitdistance. Alternatively, a fixed transfer cost can be specified for an individualtransfer schedule.– Final Leg Cost is used to calculate the cost of a final shipment to a customer.It is usually computed for a specified carrier or carrier service. A user exit isprovided to compute the final leg cost.When scheduling, the landed cost options are evaluated to determine the leastlanded cost, which is used as the cost-based option. Landed cost is prorated toreflect landed cost per unit. The priority is configured in the scheduling rules. Inaddition to the various costs listed previously, the priority can be converted intocost using the cost factor. For example, if a node within a distribution group hasa lower priority (higher priority number), the node will contribute more to thecost, compared to a higher priority node.To determine the best cost-based optimization type, a higher number ofsolutions should be evaluated. To evaluate a higher number of solutions, youcan increase the MaximumRecords in the promising and scheduling APIs. If dateoptimization is used, cost-based scheduling will not be used because the fastestoption will be considered first.Cost-Based Scheduling: An ExampleIn the following example, landed cost is computed for a given option. Let usassume that a customer orders a DVD player and three DVDs. The DVD player isavailable at DC1, and the DVDs are available at DC2. In this case, the schedule hastwo options: Option 1 is to ship individual items to the customer as two separate shipmentsfrom DC1 and DC2. Option 2 is to transfer both items to DC3, and then ship a single shipment to thecustomer from DC3.Because option 2 is less expensive, it is selected by the schedule as the cost-basedschedule option. The options are described in the following sections.Option 1Assuming that all the costs are configured, the landed cost for option 1 iscomputed as follows: In shipment 1, the DVD player is shipped directly to the customer. Thefollowing equation is used to calculate landed cost for shipment 1:(Total Item Cost + Outbound Handling Cost + Final Leg Cost) / Total UnitsIf this equation is used, the landed cost for shipment 1 is $120.50, as shown inthe following calculation:(1 unit * $100 (average cost) + $3 (per shipment) + $17.50 (ground shipping tocustomer)) / 1 unit = $120.50 In shipment 2, three DVDs are shipped from DC3 directly to the customer. Thefollowing equation is used to calculate the landed cost for shipment 2:(Item Cost + Outbound Handling Cost + Final Leg Cost) / Total Units If this equation is used, the landed cost for shipment 2 is $14.33, as shown in thefollowing calculation:(3 units * $10 (average cost) + $3 (per shipment) + $10 (ground shipping tocustomer)) / 3 units = $14.33The calculations for shipment 1 and shipment 2 are added together in order todetermine the landed cost to fulfill option 1, which is $124.83.Option 2Assuming that all the costs are configured, the landed cost for option 2 iscomputed as follows: In shipment 1, the DVD player is shipped from DC1 to DC3. The followingequation is used to calculate the landed cost for shipment 1:(Total Item Cost + Outbound Handling Cost) / Total UnitsIf this equation is used, the landed cost for shipment 2 is $106, as shown in thefollowing calculation:(1 Unit * $100 (average cost) + $3 (per shipment) + $2 (fixed transfer costbetween DC1 and DC3) + $1 (per shipment at DC3)) / 1 Unit = $106 In shipment 2, the DVDs are shipped from DC2 to DC3. The following equationis used to calculate the landed cost for shipment 2:(Total Item Cost + Outbound Handling Cost + Transfer Cost + InboundHandling Cost) / Total UnitsIf this equation is used, the landed cost for shipment 2 is $11.67, as shown in thefollowing calculation:(3 Units * $10 (average cost) + $3 (per shipment) + $1 (fixed transfer costbetween DC2 and DC3) + $1 (per shipment at DC3)) / 3 Units = $11.67 In shipment 3, the DVD player and DVDs are shipped from DC3 to thecustomer. The following equation is used to calculate the landed cost forshipment 3:(No Inventory Cost (items/are procured) + Outbound Handling Cost + FinalLeg Cost) / 4 UnitsIf this equation is used, the landed cost for shipment 3 is $3.33, as shown in thefollowing calculation:($3 (per shipment) + $7 (ground shipping to customer from DC3)) / 3 Units =$3.33The calculations for shipment 1, shipment 2, and shipment 3 are added together inorder to determine the landed cost to fulfill option 2, which is $121.Ship Complete OrderThis parameter ensures that all product lines in the promising inquiry request areeither completely scheduled or not scheduled at all. Lines could, however, besourced from different shipping locations.Ship Order from Single Ship NodeThis parameter ensures that all product lines in the promising inquiry request areeither completely scheduled or not scheduled at all. It also ensures that thecomplete request is sourced from a single node on a single date. This is a super setof ""ship complete order"" and when this parameter is set, a ""ship complete"" isassumed.Ship Complete LineThis parameter ensures that every product line on an individual line basis is eithercompletely sourced or not sourced at all. However, lines could be sourced fromdifferent shipping locations. The difference between this rule and the ""shipcomplete order"" rule is that this rule does not enforce that all lines of the requestare completely sourced. One particular line can be sourced while another line ofthe same request could be backordered.Ship Line from Single Ship NodeThis parameter ensures that every product line in the inquiry request is eithercompletely scheduled or not scheduled at all. It also ensures that each individualline is sourced from a single node on a single date. This is a super set of ""shipcomplete line"" and when this parameter is set, a ""ship complete line"" is assumed.However, this rule does not enforce that all lines are shipped from the same node.A particular line may be completely shipped from node 1 while another line couldbe completely shipped from node 2.Other Constraints for Sourcing: The following additional constraints can also beset for product sourcing.Shipping Together a Set of Product LinesThere are situations when a subset of order lines in a single order must be shippedtogether from the same node and at the same time. Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation provides the capability to create a ""ship together group of order lines"".A fill quantity can be specified for each line. At a minimum, fill quantity must beavailable for all of the lines that are part of the ship together group. All lines thatare part of this group are shipped from the same node at the same time.There is no configuration needed for this. On each order transaction, a shiptogether group can be associated by using setting the ""Ship together dependency""parameter. Select a set of lines that need to be shipped together and create thedependency group. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation promisingfunctions ensure that these lines are scheduled to ship together.Note: This constraint can be specified at line subset level only if an order exists inthe system. When making an inquiry without an order, you can specify thisconstraint at the inquiry level and Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationensures that all the lines in the request are shipped together.Deliver Together a Set of LinesThe key difference between this constraint and the ""ship together"" constraint is thatwith this constraint individual lines that are part of the dependency group can beshipped from different locations, but Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationensures that either all the lines that are part of the dependency group arescheduled for delivery or none of them are. A ""merge node"" can be specified toconsolidate these lines at a location so that it can be ensured that these lines aredelivered together. When an order release is made, ""merge node"" is applied to therelease. The shipment consolidation process also ensures that ""merge node"" isapplied to the shipment. The shipping warehouse should make sure thatshipments are made to this ""merge node"" instead of the actual ship-to location.There is no configuration needed for this. On each order transaction, a delivertogether group can be specified using the ""Deliver together dependency""parameter. Select a set of lines that need to be delivered together and create thedependency group. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation promisingfunctions ensure that these lines are scheduled to deliver together.Note: This constraint can be specified at line subset level only if an order exists inthe system. When making an inquiry without an order, you can specify thisconstraint at the inquiry level, and Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationensures that all the lines in the request are shipped together.To ensure that every shipment made for an order line has a specified minimumquantity included in that shipment, a fill quantity can be specified on any requestline. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation ensures that at least this quantityis shipped in each shipment made out of a node. If an order line's remainingquantity is less than this fill quantity, it is not scheduled. You can either cancel theremaining quantity or reduce the fill quantity appropriately.Use Single Node For Line FulfillmentThis rule mandates that an order line is fulfilled from only one node. However,unlike the scheduling rule 'Ship Line From Single Node', this rule does notmandate that lines ship completely from a single node. An order line can beshipped partially and the remaining quantity can be shipped later.If this rule is enabled, it additional features are made available including: Line splitting on partial backorder (for lines with and without pre-defined shipnodes) Backordering of a line to the most optimal ship node.For more information about these parameters, see “Backorder Handling” on page181.Calculating Expected DatesCalculations of expected shipment and delivery dates for a given inquiry involvevarious factors, such as: Minimum notification time required by the node Notification schedule Level of Service Carrier pickup schedule Carrier hold time Shipping calendar of the node Receiving calendar of the node Receipt processing time Transit time required for shipment Predefined transfer schedules between ship-from and ship-to locations Sequencing constraints defined between product and service lines Product search window - the period of time after the requested date in which anorder line can be scheduled Shipment Date CalculationsThis section discusses ship date calculations for ""As Soon As Possible"" (ASAP)orders and future orders.ASAP orders are orders that do not have any requested ship or delivery datesspecified. These orders could be shipped any time possible. Also, all orders thathave a requested ship date or requested delivery date occurring in the past areconsidered as ASAP orders and treated in this same manner.Future orders are defined as orders that have at least one of either the requestedship or delivery date defined and the specified date(s) occur in the future.To arrive at the exact ship and delivery date, system initially calculates a range ofship and delivery dates for the order line. System then refines the range to an exactdate based on various locations it is sourcing the product from.Initial Calculations of Date Ranges: The initial date ranges for ASAP and futureorders are calculated based on the following criteria: ASAP Orders– Lower boundary of the ship date is set as current time– Upper boundary of the ship date is set to the cancel date if specified. If notspecified, it is set as current time + ""Allowed shipment delay window"", aparameter setup in the scheduling rules.– Lower boundary of the delivery date is set as current time– Upper boundary of the delivery date is set as the cancel date if specified. Theonly exception to this is if the requested ship date and the cancel date werespecified without specifying any requested delivery date. The cancel date inthis case is treated as the upper boundary for the shipping date and not thedelivery date. If the cancel date was not specified, this is calculated as theupper boundary of the ship date + 60 days to take care of transit time. Whenactual dates are calculated, this transit is refined to the actual transit time. Future Orders– Lower boundary of the ship date is the requested ship date if specified. If notspecified it is set as current time.– Upper boundary of the ship date is set to the cancel date if specified. If thecancel date is not specified but the requested ship date was specified, it is setat the requested ship date + ""Allowed shipment delay window"", a parametersetup in the scheduling rules. If the requested ship date was not specified,this is set as the upper boundary of the delivery date.– Lower boundary of the delivery date is set as the requested delivery date. Ifnot specified, it is set as the lower boundary of the ship date.– Upper boundary of the delivery date is set as the cancel date if specified. Theonly exception to this is if the requested ship date and the cancel date werespecified without specifying any requested delivery date. The cancel date inthis case is treated as the upper boundary for the shipping date and not thedelivery date. If the cancel date was not specified, this is calculated as therequested delivery date + ""Allowed shipment delay days"". If the requesteddelivery date was not specified, it is set as the upper boundary of the shipdate + 60 days to take care of transit time. When the actual dates arecalculated, this transit is refined to the actual transit time.Also note that the shipment delay window is specified in elapsed days. It istypically expected that this is set to be at least more than the maximum notification time required by any node or item. If finer control is required over the last datewhen an order can be shipped, the cancel date should be used for that finercontrol. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation defaults the ""Allowedshipment delay days"" to 30 days.Initial Date Range Calculation CombinationsTable 21 details the various combinations of requested delivery dates, ship datesand cancel dates and how Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation calculatesthe initial ship and delivery date ranges. Initial Date Range Calculation ResultsThe following example illustrates the initial date ranges used for making sourcingand scheduling decisions.If you set the following parameters as indicated, the initial date range calculationresults are those listed in Table 22 on page 161 Current time = 9/8/2003 3PM Allowed shipment delay days = 30 days (Note that typically this parametershould be set to at least the notification time of any node + maximum sequentialnumber of non-working days) Shipping Calendar: A node can set up a shipping calendar or inherit thecalendars of its primary enterprise. This calendar is used to schedule shipments toensure that they are scheduled only within the working times of the node. If anode has no shipping calendar set up, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationassumes ""24 hours a day for 7 days a week"" operations, and schedules theshipment based on other parameters.Minimum Notification Time: Minimum notification time represents theminimum number of business hours it takes to ship an order once it has beenscheduled to the node. Some nodes (or external suppliers) may need 2 to 3 daysafter receiving a shipment advice to ship the order. Another node can ship anorder within 2 hours of receiving it. This parameter ensures that when makingorder promises, expectations are set correctly. This parameter can be specified atboth the shipping node and item level. The maximum of the two values calculatedagainst the current time or the next available shift is used to determine thenotification time. Combined with the shipping calendar parameter, this allows youto make accurate order promises that can be met.For example, if the minimum notification time is set to 2 hours and the ship nodeoperates between the hours of 8 to 5PM, an order must be scheduled by 3PM toship on the same day otherwise it needs to be scheduled to ship the next day.In cases where inventory information is not available from a supplier to whom youare sourcing the order, this parameter can be used to represent the lead time. Theexpected shipment date is calculated to ensure that it is at least the equivalent ofthe minimum processing time ahead of the current time thus ensuring that yourpromises can be kept.Notification Schedule: A node can configure specific days and times that it willreceive notification of orders for shipping. For example, a node could specify thatit can receive notifications only at 9:00 a.m. Monday through Thursday.This affects the notification time because, even if the node is capable of shippingtwo hours after receiving a notification, it cannot receive notification on Fridays.This notification schedule will force the notification to the following Monday at9:00 a.m.Level of Service: You can set up different Levels of Service for your business byfirst defining Levels of Service at the hub level and then configuring notificationtimes and schedules for Levels of Service at the node level. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation provides the regular Level of Service by default. Forexample, to set up Levels of Service for a business with regular and premiumservice, first define the premium Level of Service at the hub level and thenconfigure a 10-hour minimum notification time for regular orders and a 5-hourminimum notification time for premium orders.Level of Service can be specified at the order header and order line levels. If aLevel of Service is requested at a node where Levels of Service are not configured,the notification time of the item and the notification time of the node and scheduleare used; however, if Level of Service is configured at the node, only thenotification time and schedule of the Level of Service at the node are used.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation searches the order header/line todetermine notification schedules, based on the Level of Service on the order, andthen uses the specified notification schedule to calculate the expected ship date.Order lines with different Levels of Service are never part of the same release andbundled items always have the same Level of Service.Level of Service can also be specified for delivered and provided services. Forexample, a customer may request a Level of Service for a delivery/installation. Inthis case, the minimum notification time for the premium service would be lessthan the minimum notification time for the regular service, so the appointmentwould be sooner. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation ensures the sameLevel of Service is assigned to all lines of the work order (product and delivery).Carrier Pickup Schedule: A carrier pickup schedule of a node determines thedates and times when carriers pick up shipments from the node. Carriers can haveschedules for different seasons, such as the holiday and summer seasons, andschedules can include overrides for days, such as holidays. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation refers to the pickup schedules of the different carriers ofthe node when calculating shipment dates.For example, if Ground service picks up at 3 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, andFridays, an order placed at 12 p.m. Monday will ship at 3 p.m. Monday when using Ground Service. A second order placed at 3:30 p.m. Monday will not shipuntil 3 p.m. Wednesday. In the case of the second order, a different carrier maypick up the shipment if the carrier can make the delivery sooner than 3 p.m.Wednesday.The minimum notification time of a node also affects when a carrier picks up ashipment. For example, if the node in the above example requires four hoursnotification before shipping an order and an order is placed at 12 p.m. Monday, theorder will ship at 3 p.m. Wednesday using Ground service. Another order placedat 3:30 p.m. Monday will also ship at 3 p.m. Wednesday.Carrier Hold Time: The carrier hold time determines the number of days aservice carrier holds deliveries that cannot be delivered on a valid delivery day.This parameter ensures that the correct shipment date is set for carriers that do nothold deliveries for more than a specific number of days.For example, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation will not set Saturday as aship date for a carrier that holds deliveries for only one day and does not deliveron Saturdays and Sundays. However, Sunday can be set as a ship date in thisexample because the carrier will hold the delivery on Sunday and make thedelivery on Monday.Use End of Shift as Shipping Time: This parameter is used to calculate the timecomponent of the shipping date. If product is expected to ship on a particular day,the time can be chosen as the ""end of next shift"" time for that day by setting thisparameter to ""Y"". If this parameter is set to ""N"", the time component is set as ""nextworking"" time.The following examples illustrate the usage of these settings for calculating thecorrect scheduling date.End of Shift Shipping Time, Example 1Given the following scenario, an order is scheduled to ship as indicated in thefollowing table. Your Seattle distribution center works 6 days a week with Sunday as an off day. On Saturdays the working hours are between 8 AM and 12 PM and all otherdays the working hours are specified in two shifts, 8 AM to 4 PM and 4 PM to 8PM. The Minimum Notification Time = 2 hours Product availability is ""on-hand"" The ""Request to Ship Order"" is ""as soon as possible"". End of Shift Shipping Time, Example 2Given the following scenario, an order is scheduled to ship as indicated in thefollowing table. Your Washington distribution center works 5 days a week with Saturdays andSunday as non-working days. All working hours are between 8 AM to 5 PM. The Minimum Notification time = 3 days (72 hours). Product availability is ""on-hand"". The ""Request to Ship Order"" is ""as soon as possible"".Using a Pre-Defined Transfer Schedule Between Two Nodes: If the receivingnode and the shipping node have a pre-defined transfer schedule, the transferschedule is used for determining the correct expected shipment date. On a transferschedule, you can specify the days of the week on which you ship from theshipping node to the receiving node. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationassumes that shipments can be made to the receiving node only on the days of theweek specified on the transfer schedule. This constraint is added in addition to theminimum notification time to come up with the correct shipping date. Timecalculations are unchanged.You can also specify the default transit time it takes to ship from the shippingnode to the receiving node. This default time can be overridden by transit timesspecified for particular days of the week.“Transfer Shipments Using a Pre-Defined Transfer Schedule” illustrates theexpected ship date and time when using a pre-defined transfer schedule.Transfer Shipments Using a Pre-Defined Transfer ScheduleGiven the following scenario an order is scheduled to ship as indicated in Table8–6, ""Ship Time Using Pre-Defined Transfer Schedule"".Shipment is being made from your Seattle distribution center to a distributioncenter in Portland, Oregon. Your Seattle distribution center works 6 days a week with Sunday as an off day. On Saturdays the working hours are between 8 AM and 12 PM and all otherdays the working hours are specified in two shifts; 8 AM to 4 PM and 4 PM to 8PM. The Minimum Notification Time = 2 hours. A transfer schedule is defined between the Seattle and Portland distributioncenters so that shipments are made from the Seattle distribution center to thePortland distribution center every Monday and Thursday. Product availability is ""on-hand"". The ""Request to Ship Order"" is ""as soon as possible"".Requested Date Synchronization: The requested dates is synchronized withrequested ship date, delivery date, cancel dates. The dates can be synchronized atthe Order header or at the Order Line. Order dates (yfs_order_dates) at headerlevel are effected by the dates on order header record and also by the schedulerecords for the whole order. Order dates (yfs_order_dates) at line level are effectedby the dates on order line record and also by the schedule records for that line.If the order date table is modified at the order line, then the dates on the order lineis synchronized as: OrderLine.RequestShipDate=MinShipDate.Requested OrderLine.RequestedDeliveryDate=MinDeliveryDate.Requested OrderLine.CancelDate=MaxDeliveryDate.RequestedDelivery Date CalculationsDelivery dates are calculated once the ship dates are known. Following factors aretaken into account when calculating delivery dates: Transit time between the ship from and ship to locations. Pre defined transfer schedules between two locations. Days-of-week delivery can be made based on the service selected. For example,Ground service may make deliveries only Monday-Friday whereas Saturdaydelivery makes deliveries on Saturdays also. Express deliveries can be made all 7days of the week. Days-of-week delivery can be made based on the different delivery and transferschedules of the service. For example, Ground service may make deliveries onMonday and Friday during its regular schedule and Monday through Sundayduring its holiday schedule.Initial Delivery Date Range: Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationcalculates an initial delivery date range when the product can be delivered basedon the customer requested dates.The lower boundary of the initial delivery date range is set as the current time forASAP orders and requested delivery time for future orders.The upper boundary of the range is set as the lower boundary + ""Max Allowedshipment delay days"" from the associated Scheduling rule.Determining Transit Time: Transit time is defined as the time required to deliverthe product to its ship-to location once it has been shipped from the shippinglocation.If the two locations (shipping and receiving) are defined as transfer nodes, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation looks up the transfer schedule setup betweenthe two locations. If such a setup exists, the transit time is picked up from thetransfer schedule.If a transfer schedule setup does not exist between the shipping and receivinglocations, the transit time is calculated either through a user exit or by using theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation default logic.A getDeliveryLeadTime user exit can be used to determine the transit time. Thisuser exit is invoked whenever Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation needsto calculate the transit time. If you do not implement the user exit, you can setup Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation to work in one of the followingtwo modes for transit time calculation If using the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation default logic, the transittime is calculated as:A fixed unit of time + (the distance between ship-to and shippinglocation/average distance per day). Distance is calculated using thelongitude and latitude definitions of the two zip codes involved.Note: If the zip codes of the locations (ship to and shipping) are not provided,the city, state, and country information of the locations is used to calculate thedistance. In situations in which a city has multiple zip codes, the first zip codereturned from the database is used to estimate distance. The two parameters ""fixed unit of time"" and ""average distance/day"" are pickedup from different configurations based on another enterprise-level configuration.Every Enterprise can specify the ""Transit time calculation mode"" parameter asone of the following:– Basic mode - transit time calculation does not consider the carrier and servicebeing used for the transit time. The two parameters are used as configured atthe enterprise level.– Advanced mode - transit time calculation is done based on carrier and carrierservice combination level setup. The two parameters are used as configuredat the combination level. If a carrier and carrier service combination datarecord does not exist in the database, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation automatically switches to basic mode.– Based on Service mode - transit time calculation parameters are picked upfrom the Service record. The Carrier does not play a role in this mode. If nosetup exists for the service, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationautomatically defaults to Basic mode.Considering Days-of-Week Delivery at Service Level: You can specify at eachservice level the specific days of the week on which a delivery can be made. Forexample, an express service can be set up to allow deliveries to be made all sevendays of the week, but a regular service can be set up to allow deliveries to bemade only Monday through Friday.You can also specify at each service level the specific days of the week on whichthe carrier transfers shipments. The transfer schedule of the carrier can affect thetransit time of a shipment. For example, if the calculated transit time for a Fridayshipment is 48 hours and the carrier does not transfer on the weekends, theshipment will not be delivered until Tuesday.When calculating the delivery date given to a ship date, the delivery date iscalculated as the next date that occurs on or after the ship date plus thetransit-transfer time. The delivery date should be a valid day of the week for theservice chosen.For example, the transit time is calculated as 48 hours between two locations,""Ground"" service is chosen to make the delivery and is configured to makedeliveries Monday through Friday. The service transfers shipments Mondaythrough Sunday. In this example, the delivery date is Monday for any Thursday orFriday shipments.However, if the service is configured to transfer shipments only Monday throughFriday, the delivery date is Monday for Thursday shipments and Tuesday forFriday shipments.Calculating Expected Ship Date for Product ProcurementIn addition to the previously described date calculations, the Expected Ship Date(ESD) of the order when procuring product takes into consideration the procuringnodes shipping and receiving calendars as well as the nodes receipt processingtime.For example (illustrated in Figure 34 on page 168), an item is being procured fromthe Nashua warehouse to the Boston warehouse with the criteria. The Expected Delivery Date (EDD) at Boston warehouse is 10/29/03 1:00 pm. The EDD to the Boston warehouse is calculated based on previously describeddates calculations. The ESD on the order is calculated as follows:– The Expected Receiving Date at the Boston Warehouse is 10/30/03 5:00 am.(Based on the Receiving Calendar; the Boston warehouse receives Mondaythrough Friday between 5 am and 1 pm).– The Expected Receipt (complete) Date at the Boston Warehouse is 10/30/038:00 am. (10/30/03 5:00 am + 3 hours receipt processing time). The receiptprocessing time is added based upon the working hours of the receivingcalendar of the Boston warehouse.– The Expected Shipping Date from the Boston warehouse is 10/30/03 2:00 pm(Based on Shipping Calendar and assuming 'End of Shift ' is not selected; theBoston warehouse ships Monday through Friday between 2 pm and 1 pm).– The ESD on the order is calculated as 10/30/03 2:00pm.Expected Receiving Date and Expected Receipt Date are not stored in thedatabase; they are used purely for the purpose of this example.Calculating Expected Ship Date for ForwardingThe Expected Ship Date is calculated based on the forwarding node and theshipping node. As explained in the above example, (“Calculating Expected ShipDate for Product Procurement” on page 167) the date calculation remains the sameas for product procurement with changes only in the calculation of the ExpectedReceipt Date. In this case, the Boston Warehouse is considered as the forwardingnode and the receipt processing time for forwarding is 0.5 hrs. Therefore, theExpected Receipt (complete) Date at the Boston Warehouse for forwarding is10/30/03 at 5:30 am (10/30/03 5:00 am + 0.5 hours receipt processing time forforwarding).Date SynchronizationDates are synchronized when there is a change in the date for the order line or theorder header, and when a rule synchronize dates between master order dates anddates on order line and schedules is configured. The following four order dates arecreated for both the order line and the order header based on the requested andexpected ship dates:v MinShipDate MaxShipDate MinDeliveryDate MaxDeliveryDateEvery order date has an expected date, requested date, actual date, and committeddate. These order dates are specified at either the order header or at the order linelevel. Requested dates for the order dates are synchronized with requested shipdate, requested delivery date, and requested cancel date.Expected order dates at the line level are synchronized with the expected shipmentdate, and the expected delivery date of the order line schedule. Expected OrderDates at the order header are synchronized with the expected shipment date andexpected delivery date of all the order lines.Order dates at header level are effected by the dates on the order header recordand also by the schedule records for the whole order. Order dates at line level areeffected by the dates on the order line record and also by the schedule records forthat line.Requested Dates ofThe requested dates of the order are synchronized with the requested ship date,delivery date, and cancel date. Requested Dates are synchronized when thecreateOrder and the changeOrder APIs are called.If the requested order date table is modified at the order line, then the dates on theorder line are synchronized as: OrderLine.RequestShipDate=MinShipDate.Requested OrderLine.RequestedDeliveryDate=MinDeliveryDate.Requested OrderLine.CancelDate=MaxDeliveryDate.RequestedIf the requested ship date, requested delivery date, or requested cancel dates aremodified at the line level, then the requested order dates are synchronized as:MinShipDate.RequestedDate = RequestedShipDateMaxShipDate.RequestedDate = RequestedCancelDateMinDeliveryDate.RequestedDate= RequestedDeliveryDateMaxDeliveryDate.RequestedDate = RequestedCancelDate.The synchronization for the order header follows the similar logic.Expected DatesThe expected dates of the order are synchronized with order schedules. Theexpected dates are synchronized when an order line schedule is created ormodified. When there is a change in the Order Schedule, the ship dates and thedelivery dates are synchronized as:MinShipDate=Min. of all shipdates in the schedulesMaxShipDate=Max. of all shipdates in the schedulesMinDeliveryDate= Min. of all deliverydates in the schedulesMaxDeliveryDate=Max. of all deliverydates in the schedules.If there is a modification in the expected dates of the order, the order dates are notsynchronized with the order schedule.Impacts of Sourcing ModelsSo far, sourcing discussions have been related to system determination of thesourcing location and expected dates for determining product availability.Depending on the sourcing model used for sourcing the product, however: Inventory may need to be looked up in a different manner Shipping notifications may need to be handled differently Inventory supply and demand updates may need to be done differentlyThis section discusses various sourcing models that could be deployed and howSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation handles each one of them.Sourcing Model AIf you ship from stock in one of the locations owned by your organization (or thesame legal entity or node marked as ""3PL location""), Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation handles inventory lookup, shipping notification, andinventory updates as follows: Inventory lookup– The inventory organization of seller is searched for availability Shipping instruction notification– Shipping instruction is done through an Order release Inventory updates– Controlled through the status movement of the orderSourcing Model BIf you drop ship from a partner. (Shipping location belongs to a different legalentity and not marked as ""3PL location""), Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation handles inventory lookup, shipping notification, and inventory updatesas follows:The partner organization (vendor) requires a purchase order. Inventory lookup– If inventory information from the partner is available:170 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts Guide- The inventory organization of seller is searched for availability if thepartner's inventory organization is the same as the seller.- If the partner organization keeps inventory externally, a user exit is calledto get the inventory information.- Note that if the partner organization keeps inventory within Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation as part of another inventory organization thatinventory is NOT accessible.– If inventory information from the partner is NOT available:- No inventory checks are done. See “Minimum Notification Time” on page161 for calculations of shipping date. Shipping instruction notification– A ""drop ship"" chained order is created. This chained order is created in""created"" status. Notification can be send to the vendor based on the orderthat was created at an appropriate step in the pipeline. Inventory updates– All buyer supply updates are controlled through the parent order only.– Seller supply and demand updates are done from parent order. The partner organization does not require a separate purchase orderNote that the only inventory model supported for this type of organization is""Inventory maintained as part of Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation"". Inventory lookup– Inventory is searched in the inventory organization of seller. Shipping instruction notification– Shipping instruction is done through an Order release. Inventory updates– Controlled through the status movement of the orderSourcing Model CIf you procure inventory from a partner and ship from your own location, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation handles inventory lookup, shippingnotification, and inventory updates as follows: Inventory lookup– If inventory information from partner is available:- Inventory is searched in the inventory organization of the seller if thepartner's inventory organization is the same as the seller.- If the partner organization keeps inventory externally, a user exit is calledto get the inventory information.- Note that if the partner organization keeps inventory within Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation as part of another inventory organization thatinventory is NOT accessible.– If inventory information from the partner is NOT available:- No inventory checks are done.For calculations of shipping dates, see “Procurement Purchase Order” on page 181.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation includes the transit time between theprocurement location and shipping location to calculate the final ship date. SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation also takes into consideration the receivingcalendar and receipt processing time for the final shipping node. Shipping instruction notification– A ""procure to ship"" chained order is created immediately at the time ofscheduling the order. This chained order is created in ""reserved"" status.– Notification can be send to the vendor based on the order that was created atan appropriate step in the pipeline. A separate release process could beconfigured that can control notification times through the ""advancenotification days"" setting. Inventory updates– Inventory updates are done on both orders for both the buyer and thesupplier. If the partner organization does not maintain any inventoryinformation, the seller inventory updates for the procurement orders are notbe carried out.Sourcing Model DIf you procure inventory from another location owned by you and ship fromanother owned location, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation handlesinventory lookup, shipping notification, and inventory updates as follows: Inventory Lookup– Inventory is searched in the inventory organization of the seller.For calculations of shipping dates, please see “Procurement Transfer Order” onpage 180. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation includes the transit timebetween the procurement location and shipping location to calculate the final shipdate. Shipping instruction notification– A ""procure to ship"" chained order is created immediately at the time ofscheduling the order. This chained order is created in ""reserved"" status. Thedocument type to be used for this chained order is controlled through aseparate document type configuration and, by default, set to 'Transfer order'.– Notification can be sent to the node based on the order that was created at anappropriate step in the pipeline. A separate release process should beconfigured that can control notification times through the ""advancenotification days"" setting. Inventory updates– Inventory updates are done on both orders for both the buyer and thesupplier.Scheduling Shipment of an Order or Order LineSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the following parameters atvarious levels to ensure that you have the controls you need to schedule or toNOT schedule an order or order line for shipment until a specific time. Status Control Earliest Schedule DateStatus ControlThis is an order line level control - the order line status should be configured as anavailable status for the scheduling transaction.172 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideEarliest Schedule DateThis control is used to ensure that future orders are not scheduled too much inadvance and thus prevent blocking of available inventory for current or ASAPorders.The earliest date when an order line can be scheduled is calculated as follows: A date can be specified during order line creation. If specified, that date is usedas the earliest schedule date. If a date was not specified, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation calculatesthe eligible schedule date as:– The lowest of the following values to determine the maximum number ofdays to schedule before- Scheduling rule level parameter ""Schedule lead time""- Node level parameter ""Max days to schedule before"". This parameter isused only if node was pre-specified on the order line. If node is notpre-specified, the sourcing step re-determines the earliest schedule date andcan decide not to schedule the order line at that time.– Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation then calculates this date as the""ship date"" of the order line - the maximum days to schedule before asdetermined earlier. The requested ship date specified on the order is used asthe ""ship date"". If no specific requested ship date was specified, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation calculates an approximate ship date basedon the requested delivery date and the best guess transit time calculation.Note that the approximate ship date calculations may be inaccurate as theactual node from where shipment is being made may not be known. Youshould ensure that the ""Max days to schedule"" parameter is set in such a waythat the scheduling operation is performed on the order well in time.Scheduling Shipment of an Order LineGiven the following scenario the earliest schedule date is calculated as indicated inTable 23. You are creating an order line on June 29th 2003 with product as ITEM1. You have pre-specified the node on the line as NODE1.Your parameters are set as– Scheduling rules - Schedule lead time = 30 days– NODE1 - Max Schedule days = 10 days In each of these instances, order lines are considered for scheduling only after thedate calculated. If you want to schedule your order lines as soon as they arecreated, you should set the maximum scheduling days to a high value such as 999.Skipping Scheduling after the Sourcing DecisionIn situations when the shipping location is not known at the time of order creation,the earliest schedule date calculation does not take into account the Node levelparameter. When sourcing is done for the order line, the node could be an internalnode or an external supplier. You may want to schedule orders immediately if it isan external supplier or may not want to schedule orders to your own node soearly and leave the decision open. The scheduling process ensures that eventhough an order line was considered for scheduling based on initial calculations, itdoes not schedule the order line if the setup at the node where line is sourced fromindicates that it is too early.Note that in some situations, part of a dependency group may not get scheduledbecause of this reason as a particular order line in the dependency group may beskipped from scheduling whereas the remaining order lines are scheduled. If thissituation is not acceptable, set the ""Max schedule days"" parameter at the node levelto a high value such as 999.To illustrate this concept, assume that you are creating an order line on June 29th2003 with your product as ITEM1. You have NOT pre-specified a node on theorder line. Your parameters are set as: Scheduling rules - Schedule lead time = 30 days NODE1 - Max Schedule days = 10 days NODE2 - Max Schedule days = 40 daysIf the order line had a requested ship date specified as July 31st 2003, The earliestschedule date is calculated as July 1st 2003 and the order is not considered forscheduling until that time. Now, on July 1st 2003 when this order is considered forscheduling. One of the following may result: If Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation determines the sourcing node asNODE1. Since the ""Max schedule days"" for NODE1 is set as 10 days, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation does not schedule this order line. If Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation determines the sourcing node asNODE2. The order line is to be scheduled.Why an Order or Order Line is not ScheduledThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation scheduling function picks up allorder lines that are ready for scheduling based on the controls discussedpreviously. The scheduling function determines the ship node (if not alreadydetermined) and expected dates and schedules the order against the node and datedetermined. If the scheduling function cannot source the product due to anyreason, it backorders the order line (or leaves it in it's current status based onreason of failure). Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation updates a ""Schedulefailure reason"" on the order line. This reason explains why the scheduling functiondid not complete. Possible reasons for scheduling failures are: DATE_BEYOND_MAX_SCHEDULE - The ship date (specified or calculated) isin the future and the scheduling rules (Schedule lead time) or the Nodeparameter (maximum schedule lead days) do not allow scheduling this early. Ifthese parameters are set up incorrectly please correct them and re-runscheduling.174 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts Guide FILL_QTY_NOT_REMAINING - The order line has fill quantity specified but theremaining quantity is less than the specified fill quantity. The order cannot bescheduled until the fill quantity is adjusted. You can either cancel the order linefor the remaining quantity or adjust the fill quantity if it was specifiedincorrectly. FILL_QTY_NOT_AVAILABLE - The quantity remaining to schedule on the orderis more than the fill quantity but it is not available for scheduling yet. Theunavailable quantity is in a status that is not ready for scheduling. If the orderline needs a manual status change, perform that change, or once the order line isready, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation schedules the lineautomatically. NO_MORE_LEFT_TO_SCH - There is no more quantity left to schedule for theorder line. UNAVAIL_FOR_SHIP_COMPLETE - The order line or order scheduling rules areset for line ship complete or order ship complete and all order quantities are notavailable for scheduling yet. SOME_QTY_NOT_AVAIL - For product lines - The order line has a deliveryservice associated with it but some quantity of the order line is not available forscheduling yet. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation does not schedulethe order line until the complete quantity is available for scheduling transaction. QTY_NOT_AVL_FOR_SCH_YET - The order line has unscheduled quantity butzero units are available for scheduling. APPT_BEFORE_CONSTRAINT_DATE - A delivery service or provided serviceline has an appointment that occurs before the scheduled delivery date of itspre-sequenced order line. APPT_IN_THE_PAST - An appointment on the service line occurs in the past.You need to take the appointment again for the order line to schedule. CANCEL_DATE_IN_THE_PAST - The cancel date specified on the order line isin the past. You now need to cancel the order line or adjust the cancel date to anappropriate future date. NEEDS_AN_APPT_TO_SCH - This line needs a service appointment before itcan be scheduled. NO_DEL_SRVC_ATTACHED - The delivery method on the line is set up as""DEL"" (Delivery) and there is no delivery service line associated with the orderline. Associate a delivery service line. PARENT_NOT_COMPLETE - The order line is part of a sequenced line groupand it is required that the parent line be delivered before this order line can bescheduled. Wait for the pre-sequenced line to be completed before this line canbe scheduled. PARENT_NOT_SCHEDULED - The order line is part of a sequenced line groupand it is required that the parent line is scheduled before this order line can bescheduled. Look into the reason why the pre-sequenced line was not scheduledand take corrective actions on that line. Once the pre-sequenced line can bescheduled, this line becomes eligible for scheduling. CONFIRM_ASSIGNMENT_REJECTED - The scheduling function has found apossible node to ship the order line but the confirm assignment user exit rejectedscheduling of this line. PARENT_LINE_NOT_READY_TO_SCH - The order line is part of a sequencedline group and it is required that the parent line is scheduled before this orderline can be scheduled. The parent line is not ready for scheduling yet, therefore,this line cannot be scheduled. Look into the reason why the pre-sequenced line cannot be scheduled and take corrective actions on that line. Once thepre-sequenced line is ready for scheduling, this line becomes eligible forscheduling. DEPENDENCY_CONSTRAINT - The order line is dependent on another line(dependency group or sequenced group) and dependency constraints do notallow scheduling of this line. DELIVERY_SERVICE_CONSTRAINT - The delivery service is not available forthe line. NOT_ENOUGH_PRODUCT_CHOICES - Product inventory is not available forthe line. Availability is specific to the date range when product can be shipped.Please check the dates again on the order to see if increasing the ""delay window""removes this constraint. CAPACITY_NOT_AVAILABLE - The service line does not have enough capacityavailable for the requested appointment slot. DATE_CONSTRAINT - A pre-sequenced line cannot be scheduled before theallowed ship or delivery end date of this order line. NO_RESOURCE_POOL_FOUND - No resource pool serves the region or itemfor the order line. You may have to either cancel the order line or find a similarservice that serves that region. NO_ADDRESS_SPECIFIED - The order line has no ship-to address specified. NO_SOURCING_RULE_DEFINED - The order line does not have anypre-specified ship node or distribution rule and no sourcing rules are defined forthe order line. NO_PRODUCT_AVAIL - The delivery service line on which this error is shownhas delivery capacity but product is not available on the appointment date ortime. CONFLICTING_CONSTRAINTS/OTHER_CONSTRAINTS - This should happenin rare situations when Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation cannotschedule a set of order lines because they have conflicting constraints such as""ship together"" but different ship nodes specified on each line.Scheduling an Order or Order LineSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the following mechanisms toschedule an order: Use the Schedule agent for scheduling. Based on your pipeline configuration,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can invoke the schedule agent at anappropriate time and the scheduling function is carried out. Use Schedule API to request the scheduling of a particular order. You canrequest the scheduling of a particular order using this API. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation does essentially the same processing as it does with thescheduling agent except that you are controlling the sequence in which ordersare picked up for scheduling. Manually schedule the order lines. In this case, you are deciding the node anddates against which the order line should be scheduled. You should use theinventory availability inquiry API before using this API.Scheduling an Order or Order Line that is ReservedDuring the scheduling process, it searches for nodes, substitutions, and dates.However, in addition to checking the inventory, the associated reservations areused as pre-reserved inventory. These reservations are used only when they matchthe reservation parameters. For example:Order Line: Item1, Qty 5, Node1176 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideOrder Line Associated Reservations are:1. Item2, Qty 3, Node12. Item2, Qty 1, Node2Item2 is preferred substitute for Item1, and Node1 can procure from Node2. Whilescheduling runs, the only quantity that is available is Qty 1 for Item2 at Node1 orNode2. The remaining quantity is considered as pre-reserved at Node1 and Node2.If the preferred substitute is not configured, then the total of 5 units should beavailable at Node1 or at Node2, and associated reservations are not used asreservations parameters do not match.Once schedule runs on the order, it removes all reservations associated to the lineand the header. This is regardless of whether reservations were used or not. Therelease works similarly to schedule and removes all reservations.Scheduling in Reserve ModeUsually, whenever the schedule runs and it cannot schedule an order for release,the quantity is backordered. Configuration of scheduling rule allows reservation ofinventory if it is available but some of the order constraints cannot be met. Forinstance, an order is placed for 100 units and a fill quantity of 100. If 2 purchaseorders for 50 units each are coming 5 days apart, the schedule first reserves 50units against the first purchase order. Then, within 5 days, the entire line isscheduled once the complete inventory quantity becomes available. Thus, byreserving partially available inventory, the schedule ensures that line is scheduledonce the second purchase order arrives. Otherwise, another order with lessquantity could consume the first purchase order while the first order would bebackordered.Scheduling of an Order Line that is Being DeliveredAn order line with its delivery method set to Delivery cannot be scheduled unlessa service work order has been created for that line.By default, if a service work order has been created, the line can be scheduled afteran appointment has been taken. If the appointment has not been taken and ascheduling attempt is made, the line is dropped in reserved status.However, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can be configured to alloworders to be scheduled before service work order appointments are taken. Formore information, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: DistributedOrder Management Configuration Guide. For more information about service workorders, see “Service Work Order Types” on page 207.Note: If you choose to schedule and release an order at the same time, thedelivery order line is never scheduled without a work order appointment beingtaken for it, even if it is configured as allowed in the Applications Manager.Scheduling Bundles: A bundle is represented as multiple order lines withcomponents and parents. An individual line can be both a parent of a bundle aswell as a child of another bundle on the order. Each component indicates itsparent. The bundle parent indicates how the bundle needs to be scheduled. Thepossible values for the constraint are Ship Together, Deliver Together, andIndependent. This constraint is obtained from the catalog. Kit ratios are enforcedduring scheduling.The logic described in this section is considered when performing schedulingactivity.Shipping ConstraintsShipping constraints are obtained from the catalog. If the catalog is not defined, abundle is shipped together. These constraints are applied to the components at alllevels of a bundle.If the parent indicates ""ship independently"", no constraints are applied and thecomponents are treated as independent lines.If the parent indicates ""ship together"", the components are shipped together fromthe same node. However, they can be procured from different nodes and thenmerged at the shipping node to be shipped as a single shipment.If the parent indicates ""deliver together"", the expected delivery date drives the shipschedule, and the components have their shipment dates pushed out to meet thesame delivery date in ratio.Out of RatioWhen one or more of the components in a bundle are cancelled, the componentsfall out of ratio. In this scenario, the constraint ’ship together’ is not applied whilescheduling the lines that are out of ratio. For example, consider the following:Ski Package- P1Skies- C1 (Qty 2)Poles- C2 (Qty 2)Helmet- C3 (Qty 1).Availability:4C1, 4C2 available at N1, 2C1, 2 C2 available at N2.The order is created for two Ski Packages and one helmet is manually cancelled.While scheduling, C1 and C2 are completely scheduled against N1, while C3 isbackordered. If one helmet is available at N2, it is scheduled against N2, while C1and C2 are scheduled against N1. Similarly, if the bundle is scheduled against anode, and one of the components is manually backordered, the ’ship together’constraint is not applied. So in the example above, if N2 backorders the secondhelmet, it schedules C1 and C2 to N1 because it is closer. As a result, all skies andpoles ship from N1, while one helmet ships from N2.ReservationsA few components are reserved when the components cannot be scheduled in ratioand the ratio is necessary. In order to reserve, scheduling runs in two iterations.First, it attempts to schedule all the components and the components that are notscheduled are passed through scheduling again. In the second iteration, lines thathave already been scheduled as a part of first iteration are passed throughscheduling to be used only for optimizations and ship or deliver togetherconstraints. For example,178 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideScheduling optimizes on number of shipments:L1 P1 2 (Ship Together)L2 C1 Kit Ratio 3 (Total Qty 6 (2*3))L3 C2 Kit Ratio 2 (Total Qty 4 (2*2))L4 Item1 (Qty 2)Inv: Item1 2 N1, C1 - 5 N1, 5 N2During the first iteration, it schedules L4 against N1, L2 and L3 are backordered. Inthe second iteration L2 (Qty 5) is scheduled against N1 - not N2. This is becausethe number of shipments is less when compared to N2.Notification for Shipping ProductsWhen an order is ready for shipping, one of the following documents is used forcommunication of this information:v Order Releasev Drop-Ship Chained Orderv Procurement Transfer Orderv Procurement Purchase OrderOrder ReleaseIf shipment is being made from one of your owned nodes or a node not requiringa separate chained document, an order release is sent as the shipping instruction.Based on the scheduled ship date, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationcalculates a notification date. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation thencreates an order release on the notification date. The order release is thencommunicated to the shipping node to carry out the shipping process.Calculating Notification Date:The notification date is calculated based on the ""advance notification days""parameter and the ""maximum working hours"" parameter.Advance notification days are the number of days a ship node needs fornotification prior to the expected ship date. This parameter does not take thecalendar of the ship node into account. For example, a ship node might require a2-day advance notification, but if one of these days falls on a non-working holiday,the node will actually need a 3-day notification prior to shipping.Maximum working hours are the number of working hours a ship node needs fornotification prior to the expected ship date, and this takes the calendar of the shipnode into account. This parameter addresses the need for ship nodes to factor inthe non-work hours when calculating notification dates.The advance notification day parameter and the maximum working hoursparameter can be specified at:Ship node level - Advance notification days and maximum working hours.Communication to ship the order to the shipping node or supplier is made atmost this many days and this many working hours before the expectedshipment date. Item Level - Advance notification days and maximum working hours.Communication to ship the order to the shipping node or supplier is made atmost this many days before the expected shipment date. ATP rule - Advance notification days. This is used only for backwardcompatibility reasons and is compared with the item setting to pick themaximum of the two. The maximum of the two is used as advance notificationtime for the item.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses the maximum of all the advancenotification days as the advance notification day. Likewise, the maximum of all theworking hours is used as the maximum working hour. If a particular ship nodeneeds a longer notification time, you can override it at the ship node level. In somesituations, if a particular item needs special handling and a long notification time,you can override that at the item level. Because Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation takes the maximum value, timely communication is ensured.The notification date is calculated as Expected shipment date minus MaximumNotification Time (including the calendar of the shipping node) minus Advancednotification days, all based on the desired level of service.The notification date is also affected by notification schedules. If a notificationschedule exists for the level of service of the order, the calculation uses thenotification time that precedes the date calculated. For example, if a notificationschedule specifies that notification should occur every day at 5:00 p.m., and thenotification date is originally calculated as 3:00 p.m. on Thursday, when thenotification schedule is taken into account, the new notification date should be 5:00p.m. on the previous day (Wednesday) so that the node can be notified by 3:00p.m. on Thursday.An order release is created on the notification date that can be communicated tothe shipping node. Note that Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation rechecksthe availability of inventory on the notification date before creating the orderrelease. This ensures that if there was a large gap between the scheduling processand the release process, notifications are sent out only if inventory is still available.These calculations apply to both drop-ship orders and procurement order creation.Drop-Ship Chained OrderIf the sourcing function selected an external organization's node that requires youto send a separate purchasing document to be created, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation creates a ""drop-ship chained order"".If further control is required on dates when this order should be communicated tothe vendor, you can build in processes within the pipeline to control it. You canalso put in an explicit release process for the chained purchasing document.Procurement Transfer OrderA transfer order is created by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation when: The final shipping point to the customer is one of your nodes (or a 3PL node ora node owned by same legal entity)180 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts Guide The shipping node does not have enough stock and needs to be replenishedfrom another node that you own to fulfill the orderSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation creates the procurement transfer orderat the time of scheduling the original order if: The ship node and the node you are procuring from are passed in the order line,or Sourcing rules are used and are configured to use ship nodes instead ofdistribution rules.The transfer order is created in ""reserved"" status. You should configure the releaseagent to release the transfer order. Since an order release is created on the transferorder for communication, the communication date can be controlled as describedin “Order Release” on page 179.Procurement Purchase OrderA purchase order is created by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation when: The final shipping point to the customer is one of your nodes (or a 3PL node ora node owned by same legal entity) The shipping node does not have enough stock and needs to be replenishedfrom an external organization's node.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation creates the purchase order at the timeof scheduling the original order if: The ship node and the node you are procuring from are passed in the order line,or Sourcing rules are used and are configured to use ship nodes instead ofdistribution rules.The purchase order is created in ""scheduled"" status. You can configure the releaseagent to release the purchase order or decide to communicate the purchase orderdirectly.If communicating through the purchase order, you can build controls as requiredusing pipeline configuration.If an order release is created on the purchase order for communication,communication date can be controlled as described in “Order Release” on page179.Backorder HandlingWhen inventory is not available for an order line, it is backordered. When an orderline is backordered it normally needs to wait for scheduling to locate availableinventory.For certain business requirements, backordered lines need to be handleddifferently.For example: A line requires that a single node is used for fulfillment. If it is partiallybackordered, it may be required that the backordered quantity is split into adifferent line and the scheduled quantity moves forward with execution. A line on backorder should be backordered to a node based upon sourcing setup(which is the closest to the shipping location or is the highest priority node). Inthis scenario, it is required that the most optimal ship node is located and usedfor the backordered line.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides this functionality usingadditional rules at Enterprise and Document Type combination.Split On Backorder of Line With Firm Predefined NodeThis rule applies only when the Use Single Node For Line Fulfillment rule isenabled. With this rule, the system splits any order line with a firm pre-definednode that is being partially unscheduled or backordered). The quantity beingunscheduled or backordered is split into a new line.Split On Backorder of Line Without Firm Predefined NodeThis rule applies only when the Use Single Node For Line Fulfillment rule isenabled. With this rule, the system splits any order line without a firm pre-definednode that is being partially unscheduled or backordered. The portion beingunscheduled or backordered is split into a new line.Backorder Line to the Highest Priority Ship NodeThis rule is only considered if Use Single Node for Line Fulfillment is enabled andthe ship node is not a firm node. This rule backorders a line to a node which is thebest choice for fulfilling this line based upon the sourcing setup. Since inventory isnot available at any ship node, the system attempts to find the optimal ship nodewithout performing any inventory checks. If the line is completely backordered,the new node is stamped on the order line.This rule is used only during the schedule and release process"
Promising Service Requests,"This section discusses the different system components involved in making asuccessful customer promise for service items such as delivery services or providedservices.Regions and Region SchemaRegion and region schema are the building blocks for defining geography inSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation.A region schema represents the complete set of regions that define a specificgeographic area.A region schema consists of a group of hierarchical regions. Each region is itself aset of other regions or a set of zip codes forming that region.For example, geographical definition of a country like the USA could be: A region USA consisting of 50 other regions - the 50 states. Each state could consist of a varying number of regions - the counties in thestate. Each county could consist of cities or towns  Each city and town could be defined by the set of postal codes it is made up ofSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides a hierarchical way of definingregions so that aggregate regions could be defined easily and with the leastamount of data entry.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation has a broad functional footprint andsometimes a single way of defining and dividing geography may become verylimiting. For example, how territories are defined for shipping may not be thesame as required for providing installation services. For reasons like this, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation allows definition of as many Region Schemasas required. Organizations can then associate the right Region Schema for each ofthe following purposes: Shipped Product Region Schema - for purposes of shipping, very broad regionscan be defined which divide the country in much fewer regions. These regionscan then be associated with shipping nodes from where the product is shippedto the destination. Delivery Region Schema - for purposes of providing delivery services, a moregranular region definition is desired to the level of cities or towns and in somecases even sections of a city. Provided Service Region Schema - as with delivery services, a more granularregion definition is desired for this purpose. However, the way the geography isdivided might not be the same as it is for a Delivery Region Schema definition. Analytics Region Schema - for purposes of Data Warehouse Analytics. Selling Region Schema - for purposes of providing different product pricing andentitlements for different regions.Currently, region schema definition can be done only by the Hub (DEFAULT)organization. Enterprises can select the appropriate schema from the list ofschema's that the hub has created. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides a basic schema definition for the United States (US) as an optional defaultsetup. You can use this as a starting point for your schema definitions.While region schemas can only be defined at the Hub level, they can be associatedat the resource pool level. If a region schema is associated at the resource poollevel, it serves as an override to the region schema at the provider organizationlevel.Since in any given schema, a large number of regions could be defined, theconcept of region level is introduced to allow better manageability. Region levelclassifies regions into distinct categories to facilitate easier searches later. Examplesof region levels would be ""Country"", ""State"", ""City"", and so forth. Region level alsohelps to prevent data entry errors. One-time setup defines what ""level"" can be achild of which ""level"". This helps in prevention of data entry errors such as addinga ""Country"" to a ""State"" inadvertently.How Does Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation Identifythe Leaf Region for a Given Postal Code?A region can represent a set of postal code ranges. Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation selects the region that includes the required postal code as part of itsset. Since multiple regions could include the same postal code, conflict resolution isdone in the following manner: The region definition having the maximum significant digits in the range isgiven the highest preference.– For example, region R1 has specified a range of 901-902 whereas region R2has specified a zip code range as 90101-90103. When looking for a postal codeof 90101, 90102 or 90103 - R2 is selected as the correct region. When searchingfor any other postal code between 901-902, R1 is selected as the correct region. The region having the least range is given a higher preference.– For example, region R3 has specified a range of 90101-90220 whereas regionR2 has a zip code range specified as 90101-90103. When looking for postalcode of 90101,90102 or 90103 - R2 is selected as the correct region. Whensearching for any other postal code between 90101-90220, R3 is selected as thecorrect region The starting postal code closest to the required postal code is given a higherpreference.– For example, region R4 has specified a range of 90099-90102 whereas regionR2 has specified a zip code range as 90101-90103. When looking for a postalcode of 90101 or 90102, R2 is selected as the correct region. When searchingfor any other postal code between 90099-90100, R4 is selected as the correctregion.Region Match PreferencesSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation region matching allows ship toaddresses to be matched to regions for application based upon various addressfields, depending on the country the region is located within.The following are the address fields a country can be defined to match by: Country State City Zip Code Address Line 6When defining regions, a region level is specified. For example, the region ‘Boston'would be specified as a ‘City', while ‘MA' would be specified as a ‘State'.Region match preferences enable you to specify which address field to use whenmatching addresses to regions within a specific country. For example, by specifying‘City' as your region match preference for the United States (US), addressesstamped with the country code US are matched by the value of the City field inthat address.Service SlotsWhen providing any service (Delivery or Provided) an appointment with thecustomer is required. The appointment is made for the time slot when the serviceis to be provided.A capacity organization within Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation candefine multiple Slot Groups, each containing multiple Service Slots.Service SlotA service slot is identified by a start time and an end time. Service promises aremade against one of the defined slots.184 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideSlot GroupA Slot Group is identified by a Slot Group ID and is a specified set of service slots.You can associate one slot group to a resource pool.The ability to define multiple slots and slot groups enables you to takeappointments of different granularity for different resource pools. For example, fora resource pool providing delivery service, you can only promise 4-hour timeintervals, however you may be able to promise 2-hour time intervals for a resourcepool being used for some provided service. Also, sometimes the granularity coulddiffer based on the service provider being used to provide the service.To illustrate this concept, assume that you provide the following two types ofdelivery services: Curb-side delivery White-glove deliveryFor curb-side deliveries, you use a third-party delivery service provider who canonly make promises to deliver within 4-hour time slots, where as for white-glovedeliveries you use your own fleet and can make promises to deliver within 2-hourtime slots.Hierarchical Service SlotsThe slots within a slot group can be defined in different levels of hierarchy. Thehierarchical slot group may comprise parent slots and subsequent child slots.Within a hierarchical slot setup, a parent time slot usually provides the maximumcapacity that can be served by all of its child slots. This is to prevent overpromising to occur against the actual resources. As illustrated in Figure 35 on page186, if a FullDay slot is considered as the parent slot, then the Morning Slot andthe Afternoon Slot within the FullDay slot are the child slots. The child slot itselfChapter 9. Order Promising and Scheduling 185can be branched to a number of successive child slots. For example, the morningslot can be divided into AM1 and AM2 and the afternoon slot in PM1 and PM2.The hierarchical slot model allows more granularity and enables appointments tobe taken in smaller time intervals. This aids in providing extended customerservice and prevents over promising. The parent slot availability restricts theavailability of children slots.Customer Slot PreferencesIt is possible to define customer appointment slot preference in Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation, and associate service time slots with each of them. Theassociated time slots can either be preferred or mandatory. A customer servicerepresentative taking an appointment for a delivery or a service for a customer inthe Application Console is able to see which slots are preferred by that customer. Ifmandatory time slots are used, they are the only ones Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation plans an appointment against for that customer. For moreinformation about defining customer slot preferences, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Distributed Order Management Configuration Guide.Service ItemsService items can be defined within the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment FoundationCatalog Management module. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation makes aclear distinction between service items and physical products. Even though thereare some core differences in services and physical products, there is a lot ofsimilarity, too. For this reason, both physical products and service items aredefined as part of the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation CatalogManagement module.Service items are further divided into the following two broad categories: Delivery services are services associated with the delivery of the product. Typicalexamples would be curb-side delivery or white-glove delivery Provided services are services rendered before or after the delivery of theproduct. Typical examples would be ""measurement service"" or ""installationservice"".You can also define an association between physical products and servicesavailable for the product. This association can be done at an individual item levelor at the item classification level.Figure 35. Hierarchical Slots186 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideSkills for providing these services are maintained at the following levels:Service Item Service to Product Association Service to Item Classification AssociationService ResourcesA service resource in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation is used to defineone or more people that work as a team, and is represented as a single entity thatperforms provided or delivery services. Each resource has a calendar associatedwith it by either selecting one of the calendars defined by the ship node or itsprimary enterprise or using the shipping calendar of a node. This shippingcalendar can be defined by the node or inherited from the primary enterprise ofthe node. Each service resource is associated with a single resource pool.Skills and regions are defined at the resource pool level, and the resource poolcalendar is also used in addition to the calendar of the resource.This feature allows you to allocate resources at the time of appointment booking.For example, jobs that require multiple visits require the same resource to bebooked for multiple days. Also, custom tasks where the skills required to performthe task are much more difficult to model systematically also need resourcescheduling to be done. In this case, the scheduler takes into account the uniquerequirements for the job when selecting the resource.Additionally, you can associate team members with a service resource in theApplications Manager, as long as those users are defined at the level of the nodethat owns the service resource. The team members can then be associated withappointments on service work orders. For more information about associating teammembers with a service resource, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Global Inventory Visibility Configuration Guide. For more information aboutassociating team members with a service work order appointment, see the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Distributed Order Management User Guide.The capacity, consumption, and availability of a service resource or resource poolwhich maintains capacity at resource level are always calculated and stored inhours regardless of the capacity unit of measure of the resource pool.Capacity Calculation for Service ResourcesIf a resource pool maintains capacity at the service resource level, the total capacityof the resource pool is the sum of all of the capacities of the resources.The total capacity for RP1 is 19 hours, the sum of the capacities of Mike's Team,John's Team and Bob's Team.Availability Calculation for Service ResourcesThe maximum availability of a resource pool that can be allocated against is themaximum availability of the services resources maintained in that resource pool.For example, using the configuration above, the following consumptions exist forMike's Team in the 8am-12pm slot: 2 hour slot based appointment 1 hour non slot based appointmentThis consumes all of capacity of Mike's Team in the 8am-12pm slot.Although the availability of RP1 in the 8am-12pm slot is 4 hours, the maximumavailability that can be allocated against is the maximum availability of the serviceresource, which is 2 hours.Spanning Resource Capacity Across Service SlotsWhen spanning resource capacity across service slots, the service slot designatesthe range of time in which the resource is scheduled to arrive and beginperforming the services.Resource pools that maintain capacity at the service resource level and have aservice slot group that is not hierarchical can also allow resource capacity to spanacross slots. In this scenario, service resource availability is determined byconsidering adjacent shifts.A capacity organization enables resource capacity slot spanning by setting theapplicable resource capacity rule. Once a capacity organization enables resourcecapacity slot spanning, that capacity organization must specify the maximumnumber of minutes that a nonworking shift will be spanned. For example, if youhave a resource pool working from 8am to 12pm and 1pm to 5pm, this ruledetermines whether or not the nonworking time between 12pm and 1pm isallowed to be spanned and for how long. If this rule is set to less than 60 minutes,the slot is not spanned and the slot from 8am to 9am will have 4 hours availablefor an appointment. If it is set to 60 minutes or greater, it is spanned and the slotfrom 8am to 9am will have 8 hours available for an appointment. If the resourcepool is not working at the beginning of the adjacent slot, the capacity of theadjacent slot is not used. Likewise, if the end of the current slot is nonworking, thecapacity of the adjacent slot is not used. The same applies if the slot is consumedat the beginning of the adjacent slot or at the end of the current slot.The following table shows the final resource availability when slot spanning isenabled for 60 minutes prior to consumption. In this example, the entire day forthe resource pool of one (Joe) begins at 9am and ends at 8pm with a one hournonworking lunch break.Resource PoolsA resource pool in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation represents the groupof individual resources that perform the services. It is the primary mechanism ofdefining and managing capacity within the Inventory Management module ofSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. Note that it is not intended torepresent every individual resource that actually performs the service and it is onlya means to represent an aggregate service resource. Defining a resource pool givesyou the option to define capacity at the resource pool level or at the serviceresource level. Even when capacity is maintained at the resource pool level, serviceresources can still be defined for informational purposes. For more informationabout defining service resources, see “Service Resources” on page 187.Every resource pool belongs to one provider organization that owns the resourcepool. A resource pool can either provide delivery services or provided services.Also, a resource pool is associated with a single node. For a delivery serviceresource pool, this represents the node from where the delivery is made. For aprovided service resource pool, this simply represents the node that is responsiblefor the management of the resource pool capacity.You can define: The regions a resource pool serves and the day of the week as well as time ofday when it serves these individual regions Standard capacity on a day-of-the-week basis Additional capacity Supplemental capacity  Capacity overrides on an exception day basis Calendar associated with the resource poolSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation promising functions check capacityavailability against the resource pool(s) that match the service and geographyrequirements of the order line.Service SkillsEach service request may require certain skills to perform the activity. For example,Washing Machine Installation may require Plumbing and Electrical Skills. SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation also ensures that the resource pool selected fora service item should be able to provide all the skills required for the service line.Additional Fixed CapacityIn the context of a delivery service, certain regions can be considered more difficultto service than others, for certain service types. For instance, you may want toconfigure Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation so that deliveries tosuburban areas take an additional 30 minutes compared to deliveries to the city,for complex service types. You can associate additional capacity for any region andservice type combination. For more information about configuring additionalcapacity, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Catalog ManagementConfiguration Guide.Multidimensional CapacityThe multidimensional capacity aids in scheduling appointments by restricting thecapacity while planning. In addition to primary capacity, additional capacityrestrictions, such as weight and volume, can be provided.WeightThis restricts the weight of products that can be carried on a particular route.VolumeThis restricts the volume of products that can be carried on a particular route.Capacity is defined and restricted for each time slot. This results in capacityconsumed being dependent on the timeslot that is requested. In order to blockcapacity for the slot, requested capacity in every dimension should be less thanavailable capacity in every dimension for the resource pool. For example, considera full day slot whose child slots are morning and afternoon slots. The capacity isdefined for a full day slot can be restricted by any UOM like 10 hours, 100 kgs, or250 cubic feet, and the capacity for each child slot can be 5 hours, 50 kgs, and 125cubic feet. For more details refer Figure 36 on page 191.190 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideSupplemental CapacityThere can be cases where an enterprise can use supplemental capacity if it isdeemed necessary. For example, a company with 10 delivery trucks may be able touse 2 third party trucks if an important client needs products delivered by acertain date. When creating a customer through the Applications Manager, you canspecify that by default supplemental capacity is considered for that user.Supplemental capacity can be defined within each standard capacity period, for agiven day of the week. You can choose to consider supplemental capacity whentaking an appointment for a work order, and you can also choose to considersupplemental capacity when viewing available capacity in the Capacity Console.Capacity Kept ExternallyYou can specify a resource pool if capacity information is available at resource poollevel. Note that this information can be made available to promising functionseither by defining these in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment FoundationInventory Management module or by flagging the capacity organization as having""capacity kept externally"" and providing this information on a real-time basis tothe system through a defined user exit.If capacity information cannot be made available by either of the abovemechanisms, you can flag the resource pool to indicate that capacity information isnot available. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation treats this similar to""infinite"" capacity, but still takes care of the day-of-week and regions servedconsiderations.When defining a resource pool, you also need to associate it to a single capacityorganization. This resource pool can be used only by the Seller organizationswhose capacity organization is the same as the resource pool. For moreinformation about capacity organizations, see ""Capacity Organization?"" andChapter 3, “Participant Management,” on page 21.Each resource pool is associated to a slot group. All appointments taken for theresource pool are for the slots defined in this group. All capacity definitions arealso for the slots as defined in this slot group.Promising Delivery ServicesProduct lines can be associated with delivery service requests. Delivery services aretypically provided for products that: Are heavy, oversized or fragile and cannot be transported by common carriers Require special handling that requires special equipment or personnelFigure 36. Multidimensional CapacityChapter 9. Order Promising and Scheduling 191Examples of products that require delivery services are Projection TVs or WashingMachines.This section discusses product capability related to promising functions forproducts being delivered using last mile delivery services. For delivering a set ofproducts, a delivery service request must be associated with the product linesbeing delivered. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation assumes that allproduct lines must be delivered completely at the same time when scheduling thedelivery service. If any part of the product line is not available (because ofinventory, status availability or any other reason), complete delivery is notscheduled.Typical steps in the promising process for delivery services are: Inquiring about an available slot for the delivery and recording a customerappointment based on that availability Scheduling the delivery based on the recorded appointment Notifying the delivering node to make the deliveryInquiring About an Available SlotThis section discusses the functionality related to finding an available slot for thedelivery service.Basic Configuration: Some preliminary configuration is related to promising thedelivery services that are required with Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. Most of the basic configuration described in this section is defined bythe Enterprise organization. To set up your basic configuration for slot availabilityinquiries, you must set the following parameters as described:Are Delivery Sourcing Rules Defined?Sourcing rules control the delivery node selection. If you set this parameter with avalue of ""Yes"", the delivering location is determined based on your sourcing rulessetup. If this value is set to ""No"", any delivery location that serves the ""shippingregion"" can be selected by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. If you haveorganized your delivery locations such that their delivery regions do not intersectwith each other, you can set this configuration as ""No"" and Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation picks up the correct delivering location based on thedelivery regions of each node.If multiple delivery locations could serve the same region and you want to set upsourcing rules for determining the right delivery location, you should set thisparameter to ""Yes"".Capacity Organization?Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses the Capacity organizationparameter as a mechanism for separating capacity definition into distinct silos. Allresource pools defined in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation belong toone, and only one, capacity organization. An organization can use only resourcepools that are defined within the same capacity organization as that of theorganization. This definition allows Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation toprovide complete isolation for organizations that should not share any resourcepools.192 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideYou should set up your capacity organization so that it refers to the correct silo. Anorganization can have one and only one capacity organization and servicesperformed by this organization must be scheduled through a resource pool of thesame capacity organization.Is Capacity Kept Externally?This parameter controls whether or not the resource pool's capacity is maintainedwithin Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. This parameter is kept at acapacity organization level and if set to ""Y"", Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation assumes that capacity for all resource pools should be fetched inreal-time during slot availability checks.A few of the situations when you would want to set this to ""Y"" are: You are using third-party fleet management tools and do not want to define theslot capacity for each resource pool within Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. During slot availability checks, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation makes a real-time user exit call to find slot availability of theresource pool. You can pass back the availability as read from your fleetmanagement software. Note that even though capacity can be kept externally,resource pools must still be defined in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. You are using third-party service providers who can provide slot availability inreal-time. You can define a resource pool representing the third-party providerand make a real-time call to this provider during slot availability checks to getthe latest availability picture.Sourcing RulesA sourcing rule can be created by specifying one or more of the following keyparameters: Geographical region of the ship-to location or ship-to node Fulfillment type Seller organization Sourcing criteriaYou have the flexibility to leave any of the above parameters (except fulfillmenttype) as void in the sourcing rule and that implies that the sourcing rule isapplicable to all values of that parameter.For each sourcing rule, you can then specify a sequence of node or distributiongroup to be used for sourcing the product.As discussed in product sourcing, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation triesto create transfers or purchases if enough stock is not available in the deliveringlocation. Set up for procurement orders is the same as that for shipped products.For more information about procurement configuration, see “Promising forProducts Being Shipped” on page 139.Finding the Delivering LocationThe delivering location is determined based on the following: Sourcing rules if the sourcing rules are set up Resource pool serving the service region if sourcing rules are not setupChapter 9. Order Promising and Scheduling 193When determining node based on resource pool setup, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation searches for all resource pools that service the deliveryregion and have the skills needed (if any) to perform the delivery service. Allnodes associated with available resource pools are considered for sourcing theproduct.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation ensures that: The node selected has capacity available for servicing the delivery request. The node selected has availability for all the products being delivered as part ofthis delivery request. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can beconfigured to generate automatic transfer or procurement orders from otherlocations if sufficient stock is not available in the delivering location. Figure 37illustrates delivery coverage.Finding an Available SlotSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation considers all the resource pools that areassociated with the possible delivering locations and meet the following additionalconstraints: The delivery region must be serviced by the resource pool in order for it to beconsidered. If there are any skills required for performing the delivery, the resource poolprovides all those skills.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation suggests available slots based on: Resource pool availability– For checking the resource pool availability, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation ensure that:- The resource pool has sufficient capacity remaining in the slot beingconsidered. This is considered only if the resource pool has capacityinformation available. If capacity information is not available, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation consider this as ""infinite capacity"" andcan suggest this slot for recording appointments.- The resource pool serves the delivery region on that date based on its""day-of-week"" setup for the region. This check is done irrespective ofcapacity availability.- The date is not marked as a non-working day on the resource pool'scalendar. The resource pool's calendar could be overridden for the resourcepool or the default calendar of the resource pool's node is used.Figure 37. Delivery Locations194 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts Guide Product availability– Product availability of all the products being delivered - Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation ensures that all the items are available on the firstsuggested slot.– Sequencing constraints - slots are suggested based on sequencing constraintsof the order line. Minimum service notification timeA minimum service notification time can be specified at the node level. Anyservice slots starting within current time and this notification time (in businesshours) are considered as unavailable and are not suggested. Service search windowThis parameter is set up as part of the scheduling rules. This parameter sets theupper boundary on the date until which service availability is looked up to.Typically you should set this up in the range of 30 to 60 days. Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation looks up slot availability within the boundariesdefined by this parameter.When inquiring for slot availability, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationsuggests an array of slots that are available. Since a slot could be served by morethan one resource pool, the array represents availability across all resource poolsthat can serve that region and service item. The actual resource pool to use isnot locked in until the order line is scheduled.Capacity Quantity Calculations for SchedulingSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation determines the capacity quantity forwhich it checks slot availability as ""Fixed capacity units to be used for deliveryservice item + capacity units based on associated product quantity"".Capacity units to be used are based on the product association defined whencreating product and service associations in the catalog management system. Youcan define service capacity to be used / product quantity. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation calculates the variable portion of capacity as (productquantity being ordered) * (service capacity quantity / product quantity). Inaddition to all this, capacities based on options are added to the total quantity.Total capacity to check for = Fixed Quantity + Product Quantity Ordered *(servicequantity/product quantity) + Options quantity as orderedNote: If a delivery is already scheduled and an inquiry is being made foradditional lines being added to the delivery, fixed capacity and option quantity arenot included in the total capacity number.For more information about the estimated capacity calculations when creating awork order, see “Capacity Calculations for Work Order” on page 212.Scheduling a Delivery ServiceTo be able to schedule a delivery service, all product lines associated with thedelivery must be available for scheduling. See “Promising for Products BeingShipped” on page 139 for more information about product controls.A service item is moved to Reserved status when scheduled if it does not have awork order or an appointment recorded. During the scheduling process, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation assigns the resource pool that is used for thedelivery service. The delivering node selection is done as described in “Finding theDelivering Location” on page 193.Chapter 9. Order Promising and Scheduling 195If multiple resource pools are available, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationtries to schedule the delivery service using the resource pool that is not marked asthe ""secondary"" resource pool for the ship-to region. If no other resource pool isavailable, the ""secondary"" resource pool is used for scheduling.As part of the scheduling process, capacity consumption is recorded against theresource pool selected.Other Key Differences from Shipped ProductsSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation does not perform any transit timecalculations for products being delivered. The ship date and delivery date are setto appointment start times when appointments are recorded.The transfer schedule between the final ship-to location and the delivery location isnot used for determining or suggesting slot availability. Slot availability isdetermined based on resource pool constraints.Promising Provided ServicesYou can associate one or more provided services to any product line being ordered.Multiple service lines are associated with a single work order. Each service line onthe sales order is represented as a single work order service line. However whentaking appointments ONLY resource pools that provide all the service skills areconsidered. The work orders are also taken against service resources apart from theservice slots.Typical steps in the promising process for provided services are: Inquiring about an available slot for the service and recording a customerappointment based on that availability.Scheduling the service based on recorded appointment. Notifying the delivering node to make the delivery.Note: Order lines for provided services cannot be used for creating chainedorders. Likewise, when the node associated with a provided service order linebelongs to a different legal entity, the order is scheduled without creating achained order.Inquiring About an Available SlotThis section discusses the functionality related to finding an available slot for theprovided service.Basic Configuration: Some preliminary configuration is related to promising isprovided services that are required with Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. Most of the basic configuration described in this section is defined bythe Enterprise organization. To set up your basic configuration for slot availabilityinquiries, you must set the following parameters as described:Are Service Sourcing Rules Defined?Sourcing rules control the service node selection. You can set up sourcing rules tosay whether or not you define sourcing rules at all. If you set up the value of thisparameter as ""Yes"", the servicing location is determined based on your sourcingrules setup. If this value is set to ""No"", Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationselects the servicing location based on the ""service region"" served by the location.196 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideIf resource pools in your capacity organization can be used and you do nottypically have overlapping service regions between multiple service providers, thisparameter value set to ""N"" can save you the detailed configuration required forservice provider selection.Set this parameter to ""Yes"" if you want finer control over provider selection.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses your defined sourcing rules andselects the correct provider.Capacity Organization?The same capacity organization is used for both delivery and provided services.For more information about this parameter, see ""Capacity Organization?"" in thedelivery service section.Is Capacity Kept Externally?This parameter has the same behavior as defined for delivery services. For moreinformation about this parameter, see ""Is Capacity Kept Externally?"" in the deliveryservice section.Distribution GroupsA distribution group provides the facility for you to create a set of nodes orprovider organizations. You can then associate this group with a sourcing rule.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation considers all the nodes ororganizations that are part of this group and optimizes on various factors to makethe final selection. A priority number can be specified against each node ororganization that is used for node or provider selection.If you have multiple nodes or providers and you want Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation to select the node based on its build in optimization logic,create such groups and let Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation make thefinal choice of node based on your optimization parameters. If you want tosequence the node selection in a pre-defined and fixed manner use the""sequencing"" feature of the sourcing rules setup so that Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation can look up nodes in a fixed order.Sourcing RulesSourcing rules are defined similar to sourcing rules for products being shipped.Except for the difference that Product Class and Item Classification parameters arenot available for setting up the sourcing rule, the rest of the sourcing ruleconfiguration is the same as that described in “Sourcing Rules” on page 144 forproducts being shipped.Finding the Servicing LocationThe servicing location is determined based on: Sourcing rules if the sourcing rules are set up The resource pool serving the service region if sourcing rules are not setupWhen determining the node based on resource pool setup, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation searches for all the resource pool's that service the region.All the nodes associated with available resource pools are considered for sourcingthe service.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation ensures that the node selected has thecapacity available for servicing the service request.Chapter 9. Order Promising and Scheduling 197Finding an Available SlotSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation considers all the resource pools that areassociated with the possible servicing locations and meet following additionalconstraints: The serviced region must be serviced by the resource pool for it to beconsidered. If there are any skills required for performing the delivery, the resource poolprovides all those skills.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation suggests available slots based on: Resource pool availability– For checking the resource pool availability Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation ensures that:- The resource pool has sufficient capacity remaining in the slot beingconsidered. This is considered only if the resource pool has capacityinformation available. If capacity information is not available, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation considers this as ""infinite capacity"" andcan suggest this slot for recording appointments.- The resource pool serves the delivery region on that date based on its""day-of-week"" setup for the region. This check is done irrespective ofcapacity availability.- The date is not marked as a non-working day in resource pool's calendar.The resource pool's calendar could be overridden for the resource pool orthe default calendar of the resource pool's node is used. Minimum service notification timeA minimum service notification time can be specified at the node level. Anyservice slots starting within current time and this notification time (in businesshours) are considered as unavailable and are not suggested. Service search windowThis parameter is set up as part of the scheduling rules. This parameter sets theupper boundary on the date until which service availability is looked up to.Typically you should set this up in the range of 30 to 60 days. Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation looks up slot availability within the boundariesdefined by this parameter.When inquiring for slot availability, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationsuggests an array of slots that are available. Since a slot could be served by morethan one resource pool, the array represents availability across all resource poolsthat can serve that region and service item. The actual resource pool to use isnot locked in until the order line is scheduled.Scheduling a Provided ServiceControls to determine when a provided service line should be scheduled aresimilar to those for delivery services. See “Scheduling a Delivery Service” on page195 for more details."
Complex Sequencing of Order Lines,"Controls are provided so that you can sequence various product deliveries andassociated services. You may want to complete certain pre-delivery services beforea product is delivered and then perform some post-delivery services ensuring thatthese are scheduled only after the product has been delivered. Product Concepts GuideWhen setting up a product-to-service association, an offset can be specified. A -veoffset denotes that the service must be performed at least offset number of hoursbefore the product delivery. A +ve offset denotes that the service must be performedat least offset number of hours after the product has been delivered. The hoursspecified are treated as elapsed hours and not business hours. For this discussion,whenever a service line is sequenced before the product line, it is referred to as apre-sequenced line, otherwise it is referred to as a post-sequenced line.Combined with the offset hours, line dependencies explained earlier create acomplex sequencing situation where a line should not be scheduled before or aftera certain time. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation calculates twoconstraining dates: Cannot complete before date - the date before which the order line should notbe scheduled for completion. Completion is denoted by the delivery of productlines and recording of service completion for service lines. This date can beimposed on a line because of any of the following:– A pre-sequenced line has been scheduled already. The constraint daterepresents the last scheduled delivery date of the pre-sequenced line + offsethours specified on the product-to-service association.– A pre-sequenced line has a requested delivery data specified. This daterepresents requested delivery date of pre-sequenced line + offset hours.– A pre-sequenced line already has an appointment recorded. This daterepresents the last appointment time + offset hours.v Cannot complete after date - The date after which the order line should not bescheduled for completion. Even though Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation calculates and shows this date in its user interfaces, this date is notused as a real constraint on the pre-sequenced line. The main reason for this isthat in some situations a dead lock can be created between pre-sequenced andpost-sequenced lines and no scheduling operations can be performed. To avoidsuch situations, this constraint is treated as a soft constraint and not imposed onthe line. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation highlights lines that do notmeet the ""Cannot complete after date"" constraints. This date can be imposed ona line because of any of the following:– A post-sequenced line has a requested cancel date specified. This daterepresents the requested cancel date of the post-sequenced line - offset hours.– A post-sequenced line has an appointment date recorded. This date representsthe first appointment date of the post-sequenced line - offset hours.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation highlights an order line if it has anappointment or delivery schedule that does not meet the above constraints.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation also calculates an indicator called""Cannot schedule"". This indicator denotes that an order line that has this indicatorset to ""No"" cannot be scheduled. Reasons for this are caused by one of thefollowing: A pre-sequenced line has not been scheduled yet. All pre-sequenced lines mustbe scheduled before a post-sequenced line is scheduled. When associating product with services ""Hold scheduling for completion"" wasmarked as true and a pre-sequenced line has not been completed yet.Even though a line may be marked as ""cannot schedule"", Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation lets you inquire for the best possible appointmentavailability. You can also record the desired appointment. However, you cannotschedule the line unless the constraints preventing the line from being scheduledhave been removed.Using the above parameters you can effectively record appointments for linesrequiring complex sequencing and then schedule them at appropriate times."
Item-Based Allocation,"Item-based allocation (IBA) is a process that reallocates the uncommitted andcommitted demands for items of existing orders to more suitable supplies based onuser configuration and supply and demand changes in the system.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides two types of item-basedallocation options:v FIFO prioritization, giving orders that are placed first a higher priority thanthose placed later.v User-configured prioritization based on order attributes, giving the specifiedorders higher priority than othersWhen user-configured IBA priorities are not set, or they are set and completed,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation defaults to system-configured IBApriorities.This subsequent sections describe both types of IBA.FIFO IBAIn the default, FIFO IBA, the demands of the impacted orders are reallocated in theFIFO order. This means that the orders that are placed first are promised prior tothe placing of orders. For example, the orders shown in Table 26 exist in thesystem with their corresponding supplies and demands. Assume that it takes oneday to ship out orders after a purchase order has been received.The Item Based Allocation functionality consists of two processes that should beperformed one after the other, as described here:1. Identifying items to perform Item-based Allocation.The process of identifying items is as follows:a. Detecting when Item-Based Allocation is required for an item:Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation detects that the Item BasedAllocation process is required for an item at a node when there is noon-hand availability. This occurs when Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation is retrieving the availability of an item with the intent toperform an update through promising APIs such asreserveAvailableInventory, modifyWorkOrder, scheduleOrder, andreleaseOrder. If the Use Item Based Allocation rule is enabled and there isno on-hand availability at any node, an Item-Based Allocation trigger isinserted (if it does not already exist) into the YFS_IBA_TRIGGER table forthe item and node combination with the IBA_REQUIRED flag set to ""Y""(only when the item and node have IsItemBasedAllocationAllowed =""Y"").This indicates that the IBA process is required for the item at the indicatednode and the system is now allowing the triggering of the item-nodecombination to be processed by the IBA agent.b. Triggering the Item-Based Allocation agent to process an item and a node:After Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation detects that theItem-Based Allocation process is required for an item at a node (a recordexists in the YFS_IBA_TRIGGER table with IBA_REQUIRED=""Y""), SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation allows triggering of that item-nodecombination to be processed by the Item-Based Allocation agent, based onthe following occurrences.c. When Supply ChangesWhen changes in the supply occur and the supply type hasTriggerItemBasedAllocation=""Y"", Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationtriggers the inventory item and node to be processed by the IBA agent byupdating the IBA_RUN_REQUIRED field to ""Y"".d. When Certain Demand ChangesWhen there is a change in the demand, the inventory item and the node aretriggered to be processed by the IBA agent by updating theIBA_RUN_REQUIRED field to ""Y"" in the YFS_IBA_TRIGGER table.When the following changes occur, the inventory item and node aretriggered to be processed by the IBA agent by the IBA agent by updatingthe IBA_RUN_REQUIRED field set to “Y” in the YFS_IBA_TRIGGER table.Order cancellationOrder backordered or backordered from nodeReservation cancellation2. Performing the Item Based Allocation processItem-Based Allocation process is performed by the Item-Based Allocation agentunder the General process type. For each item-node combination that istriggered, the agent finds all the applicable order lines or order linereservations containing the item-node combination and tries to move theiruncommitted and committed demands to a more suitable format based on theavailable supplies, which is in turn based on the user-configured IBA selectionrules or the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) IBA selection rules.The system then creates new positive order line reservations with the matchedsupply's first ship date and negative order line reservations for the existingdemand ship date. After the orders are processed, they are put on hold to berescheduled if changes are detected in the order line reservations of the order.The rescheduling process performs the actual rescheduling of the orders byutilizing the order line reservations created by the Item-Based Allocationprocess.Note: A hold type is required to be set up for the change order linereservations modification type so that the order can be placed on hold forscheduling.User-Configured IBAIn user-configured IBA, rules can be defined to provide sequences and conditionsto orders and order lines. A condition can be created, and orders matching thiscondition will be given priority. For example, in Table 28, Buyer1, Buyer 2, andBuyer3 are competing for inventory."
Rescheduling,"Rescheduling of an order is allowed when the attributes that are important forscheduling are modified. This is enabled only through order holds and thefollowing user configuration: The user has to create a hold type This hold should prevent ReleaseOrder and CreateChainedOrder Transactionsfrom picking an order This hold should be triggered by modification types that impacts scheduling(Order Line Reservation Change, ShipToAddress Change, Node change, and soon) This hold should be resolvable by SCHEDULE transaction.Note: If you must reschedule an order because of inventory changes, use IBAinstead of the rescheduling feature. For more information about IBA, refer to“Item-Based Allocation” on page 200.Whenever schedule picks up an order, it checks if the order has any active holdsthat schedule is configured to resolve. If so, then it confirms that schedule is inreschedule mode. After the schedule ends, it closes all holds that were configuredto resolve, unless an order could not be processed.When there is any modification to the line and line has been scheduled, order lineschedules remain unchanged. The line goes on hold and then is be rescheduled.Once the schedule ends, the hold type is removed from the order."
Introduction to Value-Added Services,"Value-Added Services (VAS) are performed to meet customer demands. They canbe activities performed on a product before the product is delivered to thecustomer, or a provided service that is performed at the customer site.Activities can be performed at all types of facilities including manufacturingfacilities and flow-through or distribution centers. Some examples of VAS done atthe vendor site are: A vendor applies a license plate number (LPN) label on a carton based on themanufacturer's specification. A manufacturer applies price ticket or SKU labels based on the requirements of aretailer. A warehouse builds a pallet using customer requirements. A warehouse applies security tags on a class of items before shipping to certainretailers. A warehouse assembles components and builds a kit before shipping.Provided services are usually purchased by the customer for an additional fee.Some examples of activities that are offered as a provided service are: Installing a customer's home theater system. Providing maintenance to a furnace as part of a service contract. Installing software on a new computer, and configuring the computer to workon a home network."
Using Value-Added Services,"Some examples of how value added services are used within the manufacturing,vendor, or shipping facilities are: VAS for stocking — a facility performs the VAS operations for stockingperiodically on the basis of expected demand for a product. For example, awarehouse ships pens, pencils and erasers separately. In addition, thatwarehouse may also ship a student package, which consists of 2 pens, 2 pencilsand an eraser. VAS for a customer — this type of VAS operation is performed to meet specificcustomer requirements, such as special ticketing or security tagging. The SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation allows the customization of inventory for abuyer at a node and ensures allocation to that customer. This scenario is referredto as made-to-customer, or buyer compliance. The customer usually makesrepeated purchases of these specialized items. This type of VAS is performed ina warehouse based on the demand forecast to reduce order cycle time. VAS for an order — this is applicable when:– A customer selects a customization when ordering an item, like monogram ona shirt. The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationcreates a work order toperform these services in a warehouse and ensures that inventory is allocatedonly to that order. This is also referred to as made-to-order.– A customer orders a dynamic physical kit and selects the requiredcomponents for that item. The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationcreates a work order to assemble the kit and ensures that the inventory of theassembled unit is allocated only to that order. This is also referred to as Builtto Order, or made-to-order.– Inbound shipments that require packaging. Parts received that requirepackaging to a specified unit of measure. Breaking kits or Dekitting — this is performed on kits in inventory that are notrequired anymore. For example, inventory leftover from a seasonal promotionmay be dekitted and the components can be used in other kits or soldindividually. Unit of Measure (UOM) Conversions — a warehouse may create a work orderto convert inventory from one UOM to another. For example, a warehouse maytrack inventory of screws individually as well as in packs of 50. A work order iscreated to convert single inventory units to packs of 50. Gift Wrap Services — a ship node may offer gift wrap services on items that areeligible for gift wrap. This flag is enabled for a node during Participant Setupfor Sourcing/Scheduling Node Attributes."
Postponing Item Creation,"One approach to providing Value-Added Services at the warehouse or otherfacility is to delay customization processes until an order is received. This isreferred to as 'postponement'. An example of a postponement process is shown inthe Figure 38. The warehouse stores generic product awaiting the customerdemand to customize the product. After receiving an order, additional services areperformed on the generic inventory to convert the generic inventory into customerrequested specific inventory. This increases the order cycle time while reducing therisk of unusable inventory.In the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, value-added services areexecuted by creating a work order. A work order is initiated automatically basedon a demand, or manually by a user. The Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation manages the execution of a work order through retrieval of inventoryto the VAS department, recording of completion towards the final inventory, andputaway of the product to appropriate departments."
Work Order Creation,"A work order in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation captures theactivity required to perform a service. A work order is created in the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation by one of the following methods: Manual creation - A user initiates a request using the Work Order Console forrepackaging, UOM conversions, labeling, or dekitting. Automatic creation based on Inventory levels - A request is issued by theinventory monitor in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uponminimum or maximum levels being reached for a SKU. Automatic creation based on an order - A request issued by a sales order for anitem on the order. This typically occurs for made-to-order or made-to-customeritems.When a work order is created, it consists of one or more of the following types ofservices: Kitting Service - Assembling components for a kit item Dekitting Service - Disassembling a kit item. This may be done to acquire anindividual component to complete another order. Compliance Service - Value-added services that should be performed to supplyan item to a specific buyer for made-to-customer orders. Inventory Change - Converting inventory from one UOM to another. Provided Service - Service executed at a customer site. Delivery Service - Service executed for product delivery to the customer site.One or more services can be included in a work order, and have a sequencenumber assigned which indicates the order in which they should be performed.Each service can contain one or more service activities, which specifies the categoryof activity, such as Assemble Components, Apply Logos, or Pack Components.Provided Services are not combined with other services."
Work Order Hold Types,"Work orders may need to be held at one point through their life cycle. Forexample, certain complex services may require a number of compatible productsand services, as well as service tools. A supervisor may be required to verify workorders with such services before appointments can be taken.The order hold type functionality, described in “Order Hold Processing” on page125, is also available to work orders. The only difference is that a work ordercannot be in a draft status, therefore the hold can only be created automatically onwork order creation, on resolution of another hold type, or through a modificationtype."
Service Work Order Types,"The service work order consists of work order service lines, delivery lines andappointments that had to be taken for the work order. The key difference betweenthe service work order and other value-added services is that the servicesassociated with a service work order are usually supplied to the customer at thecustomer’s location, while value-added services are usually performed at thewarehouse or other assembly location. Although they differ in this way, manybusinesses treat provided services as a work order that can either be done by theseller or can be performed by a third party.A service supervisor can be specified for a service work order. Typically, asupervisor is responsible for managing work orders that originate from a specificset of nodes. If a store supervisor is specified on a service work order,appointments are only allowed to be placed against the resource pools supervisedby that user.The supervisor can be set at the following three levels, in order of priority: For a given node and seller organization combination For a given resource pool For a nodeFor example, if a given service work order is placed for a given seller organization,the supervisor defined for that seller organization and node combination is chosenover the default supervisor defined for that node.A service work order is divided into two basic types: Provided service work order Delivery service work orderMultiple Service Lines on a Single Work OrderYou can have multiple service lines on a single work order. Each service line onthe sales order is represented as a work order service line.For example, consider a case where a customer orders a TV, receiver, speakers andinstallation for each one of the products modeled as separate service lines. If thecustomer requires everything to be installed together during a single visit, all thethree installations can be included on one work order. A single appointment toinstall all three services is taken. In this case only a resource pool that can provideall three services is considered when taking appointments. Therefore if thecustomer needs to change the appointment dates later, only a single modification isrequired.A service work order with multiple service lines takes on the highest service levelbased on the service types associated to the service items. Furthermore, serviceitems with the same item group code as the work order are considered for servicelevel determination. For example, if a provided service work order contains aprovided service item with a ‘Low’ service level and a delivery service item with a‘High’ service level, the service level on the work order is ‘Low’. The service levelis recomputed every time a service line is added or removed.Work Order with Service ResourcesWhen a work order is more complex and requires people with different skills,resource pool blocking is not sufficient and taking appointments against serviceresources is pertinent. A resource is a team that can provide either a provided or adelivery service. For more information about defining service resources, see theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Global Inventory Visibility ConfigurationGuide.Whenever a resource pool defines resources, appointments can be taken against theresource based on either calendar dates or time slot. For example, an appointmenton the work order for a resource is between 8:30 AM - 5:30 PM.208 Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Product Concepts GuideMulti-Day Work OrderThe ability to make multiple appointments for a single work order is helpful if youhave a job that spans over a few days. In order to make multiple appointmentsyou must enable the checkbox for Multiple Appointments when creating a workorder. Once this flag is enabled you can add additional appointments and modifyexisting ones.Note: Once the Multiple Appointments checkbox is enabled, it cannot be disabled.With multiple appointments, work order capacity can be over allocated, becausesuch jobs are usually scheduled for experienced professional. For example, if itrequires 35 hours to complete a custom job, then a total of 5 working daysconsisting of 8 hours each day could be allocated for a specific resource.Provided Service Work OrderEach provided service line on the work order corresponds to a single line on theorder. Customers order provided services in the same way as they order products.Services are modeled within Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation as serviceitems. Services can be ordered alone or along with a product when purchased.Including the provided service line on the work order does NOT imply that allproduct lines associated with that provided service line are completed on thatwork order.Provided Service Work Order with Products to be DeliveredWhen a customer buys a product and orders installation and delivery at the sametime, the installer delivers the product. To allow for such cases you can make useof the Products To Be Delivered option in the Work Order Details screen. As aresult, a single line that provides both the provided and delivery services iscreated.Lines on a work order can be from multiple sales orders. For example, in the caseof a product exchange, removal and uninstallation of the old product are able to beincluded on the same work order as delivery and installation of the new item.However, the delivery service lines are ignored for service items or skills whenlooking for available resource pools to accommodate the appointments.If a work order consists of both provided and delivery service lines, then the workorder is considered to be a provided service. The service item UOM is same as theprovided service capacity UOM. The ServiceItemGroupCode is ’PS’.Synchronization of Work and Exchange OrdersLines on a work order can be from multiple sales orders. For example, if acustomer wishes to return a newly installed dishwasher and replace it with one ofa different color, a return order containing the uninstallation and pickup of the olddishwasher, along with the dishwasher itself is created. An exchange order is alsocreated containing the new dishwasher, along with delivery and installationservices for that new dishwasher. The user then has the option of generating asingle work order that contains the following: New dishwasher Dishwasher delivery (Delivery Service) Dishwasher installation (Provided Service) Old dishwasher Dishwasher pickup (Provided Service) Dishwasher uninstallation (PS)This enables the user to create only one appointment for both tasks.Delivery Service Work OrderWork orders can contain delivery items with associated products. This is essentialif the products to be delivered are large and the installer cannot deliver them or ifthe customer has ordered just delivery without installation. Including the deliveryservice line on the work order does NOT imply that all product lines associatedwith that delivery line are delivered on that work order.Work orders can also contain stand-alone delivery service lines, that can later beassociated with a product line if needed.Only product lines included in the work order are delivered as part of the workorder execution.Dynamically Determining Work Order TypeThe work order type, either Provided Service (PS) or Delivery Service (DS), isautomatically determined based upon what types of lines are present on the workorder. This determination can occur at order creation or during a change in thework order. Work order type is based on the following logic. A work order is considered to be a PS work order if there is at least one PS linepresent. A work order is considered to be a DS work order if all the lines present are DSlines.The work order type can be switched dynamically when lines are added orremoved from the work order. For example, on a PS work order that contains bothPS and DS lines, removing all of the PS lines results in the work order becoming aDS work order.Because updating the work order type changes the item group code, the followinginformation is also be updated automatically: Service Item Group Code Required Capacity Capacity Unit of MeasureComplexity levelThe resource pool for the work order appointment is also updated upon a workorder type change.If the Resource Pool was manually passed on the appointment, the appointmentmust be retaken manually after a work order type change."
Service Work Order Creation,"A service work order is created from a sales order when there are service linesassociated with the product. The creation of a work order does not change thestatus on the order and is allowed for order lines that have not yet been scheduled.Each work order relates to a single order line. However, you cannot include awork order for order lines that are completely shipped or cancelled. Keeping thisconsideration in mind, any number of provided service, delivery service, andproduct lines can be added to a work order.Additionally, certain items can be configured as service tools that can be added towork orders. Typically, those are items that are used by service resources toperform the necessary tasks on the work order, for example a ladder, or a tool kit.The following validations performed at work order creation: All provided service lines should have the same unit of measure. If the work order is a delivery service order without any provided service lines,all of the service lines should have the same unit of measure. The Products To Be Delivered option can only be set for provided service ordelivery service work orders. All the lines that are included in the work order should have the same shipping(Ship To) address.Provided Service or Delivery Service Work OrderDeterminationThe type of work order is defined using the following criteria: If only delivery service lines and product lines are included in the work order,the work order is termed as a delivery service work order. If there is at least one provided service line present in the work order with thefollowing combinations, then the work order is a provided service work order:– Provided service lines.– Provided service lines along with product lines.– Provided service lines along with product lines and delivery service lines.When the work order contains delivery service lines only, you cannot add aprovided service line. If the work order is a provided service work order, then youcan add delivery lines but the work order type does not change.Work Order Node DeterminationEach work order should be created for the specific node which owns the workorder execution. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation determines the workorder node based on the following criteria: If a node is specified during work order creation it is used. If a node is specified on any of the service lines, that node is used as the workorder node. If capacity is blocked by an order line, the node of the resource pool that wasused to block the capacity is used. If there is no predefined node on the work order or the service lines, thesourcing rules for either provided service (for a provided service work order) ordelivery service (for a delivery service work order) is used. In this case theprimary node is used as the work order node.Note: In all of the above situations, if there is more than one node specified forthe service lines, a work order node cannot be created. Therefore if you do notspecify the work order node during work order creation, you have to make surethat you can cite only one node in all of the service lines.A node cannot be changed on the work order. If you have to change the node, thework order must be cancelled and recreated.Work Order Provider Organization DeterminationSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation determines the work order providerorganization based on the following criteria: If the work order is a provided service work order, the owner of the work ordership node becomes the provider organization. The provider organization isALWAYS determined when the work order is created. Therefore the providerorganization cannot be changed on the work order after creation. If the work order is a delivery service work order, then the providerorganization can be specified during work order creation. However, novalidations are made to ensure that the provider organization has resource poolsdefined for the work order ship node.Even after meeting this criteria, if the provider organization cannot be determined,it is left blank on the work order. It can be either set later by passing the ProviderOrganization using the modifyWorkOrder API or by making the first appointment.In the latter case, the provider organization for the resource pool is assumed forthe work order.Capacity Calculations for Work OrderEach service line added to a work order, except when provided and deliveryservice lines are mixed on the same work order, contributes to the computedcapacity. The capacity for an item can be computed either using productassociation or the ordered quantity.For example, if the provided service line has 2 associated product lines with aquantity of 3 in each line. Then the total required capacity for the work order is 2 x3 x CapacityMultiplier. The CapacityMultiplier is a multiplication factor whichvaries between a provided or a delivery service work order.Capacity Calculation for a Delivery Service Work OrderComputedCapacity = Max (fixed capacity of each delivery service line) +Sum (variable capacity of all delivery service lines)The product catalog is used to determine the fixed and variable capacities. Ifcapacity is estimated based on the ordered quantity, then computed capacity iscalculated for a fixed capacity.Additionally, required quantity of a delivery service line is computed based on theproduct lines included in the work order. However, when the service lines areadded or removed, the requested quantity is recomputed unless the capacityoverridden option is enabled in the work order. When a product that must bedelivered, is not associated to a delivery service line on the sales order, theassociation is computed from the product catalog for variable capacity.If there is more than one delivery service line on a delivery service work order, avariable capacity is computed for the item that is associated with the productcatalog. In the case of more than one delivery service lines, the capacity for thedelivery service work order is chosen at random. When a product is not associatedwith any delivery service item in the catalog it contributes 0 capacity.Additional factors can also be taken into account when calculating requiredcapacity on a delivery service work order. For more information about additionalfixed capacity and supplemental capacity, see “Resource Pools” on page 189. Formore information about capacity impact for answers, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Distributed Order Management Configuration Guide.Capacity Calculation for Provided Service Work OrderComputedCapacity = Sum (fixed capacity on all provided service lines) +Sum (variable capacity of all provided service lines)The capacity is considered to be fixed, when the computation is based on theordered quantity.RequestedCapacity = ComputedCapacity + AdditionalRequestedCapacityThe AdditionalRequestedCapacity can be used to manually specify any additionalcapacity required. This value can be a positive or negative number. For example,when the installer delivers the product and the field supervisor knows that itrequires an extra 30 minutes to pick up the product from the hub. In this case, theadditional 30 minutes is considered as AdditionalRequestedCapacity.However, this additional capacity can be overridden on the work order creation bymanually specifying the requested quantity. The use-case of this situation arises forcomplex jobs where required capacity cannot be derived based on the service itemassociations.Once requested quantity is overridden any changes to the quantities on the orderlines do not result a change in the requested capacities. However, when the lastservice line is cancelled then the entire work order is cancelled.The QuantityRequested indicates the measure of capacity needed to complete thework order. The blocked capacity is provided as AllocatedQuantity while planningappointments. In most cases, the allocated and requested quantity remains thesame once an appointment creation process is complete.Additional factors can also be taken into account when calculating requiredcapacity on a provided service work order. For more information about capacityimpact for answers, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: DistributedOrder Management Configuration Guide.Product Reservation for a Service Work OrderProduct reservation is attempted by the schedule transaction which is called toreserve an item based on the requested ship date specified on the sales order. If theproduct cannot be scheduled for release, the schedule transaction puts the productline in reserved status.Once the product line is reserved, the ship node on the work order line ispopulated as a non-firm ship node. When determining the ship node for productlines on the work order, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation considers thefollowing: If product lines have predefined ship nodes, they are used for productreservation. If no node was specified on the product line and it is a delivery service workorder, the ship node on the delivery service line is used.Chapter 10. Value-Added Services 213 If no node was specified on the product line and it is a provided service workorder then the following considerations are made:– The node of the service installer is used as the delivering node of the product.If this option is selected, the ship node on the work order line is used toattempt product reservation. This option can be used when inventory isphysically located at the installer hub.– The standard rules for determining the delivering node of the product isused. This option can be used when it is insignificant if the service installerdelivers the product or the product is separately delivered."
Confirming a Work Order,"To confirm a work order, you need to specify the appointment that is beingconfirmed, the outcome of the appointment, and the execution details. However,the delivery service lines on the work order are not marked as completed. They aremoved to delivered status. The work order is considered complete when all theprovided service lines are completed and all products are delivered. In a singlework order confirmation, multiple appointments can be completed. If theconfirmWorkOrder API is called to confirm the work order then all openappointments are cancelled and allocated capacity are removed.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation also provides the capability to confirmwork orders without specifying the appointment details. If, as part of the workorder completion, all service lines (provided service and delivery service) arecompleted and all products are delivered, open appointments on the work orderare resolved as follows: For a work order with a single appointment, the appointment is marked ascompleted. For a work order with multiple appointments, all appointments in the past aremarked as completed, and future appointments are cancelled."
Work Order Cancellation,"Work order cancellation depends on the status of the service lines. If any of theservice lines were completed or any of the product lines were delivered, then thework order is marked as completed. Only appointments that are open arecancelled and the associated capacity reservation is removed.It is also possible to request cancellation of a delivery, after a product has beenshipped. If a customer decides that they no longer want the item they originallyordered, but the item has already shipped, a stop delivery request can be created.If this request is successful, a return order is automatically created."
Appointment Status,"An appointment status depicts the status of the work order appointments. Theappointment status is associated with the blocked capacity. The appointment starttime represents the minimum of all appointment start times that are currentlyblocking the capacities. The appointment end time represents the maximum of allappointment end times that are currently blocking capacities. Wheneverappointments are made without a capacity check they can be overridden.The possible statuses for appointments are:Open Completed Failed CancelledOpenWhen an appointment is taken against a work order the appointment status is setto Open. This is true even if the capacity is overridden or resource pool requiresconfirmation. This status indicates that the appointment has been taken.CompletedWhen an appointment is recorded as a successful execution the appointment statusis changed to Complete. Once the appointment is marked as complete theappointment details cannot be changed.FailedIf the customer is not available the appointment is changed to Failed. Theappointment cannot be changed to any other status once it is marked as Failed. Ifthe customer is available at a later date, the appointment should be re-created.CancelledThe appointment status is set to Cancelled if an appointment is cancelled as aresult of work order cancellation or work order completion. When a work order isbeing confirmed and if all the services are completed along with the productdelivery, all appointments that are not failed or completed are marked asCancelled.Procedure Involved in Taking AppointmentsYou can make appointments directly on the work order once it is created.Appointments are made for a resource pool or a service resource. Only theresource pool that provides all the skills or service items for all the service linesthat are required, are included on the work order. To increase the option ofselecting more than one resource pool you can opt to ignore the productavailability while checking for resource pool availability. Appointments can beslot-based or calendar-based.Slot-Based AppointmentsWhen an appointment is slot-based, the start and end time of the appointmentindicate the actual time slot. If the resource pool is time-based, the differencebetween promised appointment start and end dates indicate the required capacity.Slot-based appointments can be made for either a resource pool or a serviceresource.Calendar-Based AppointmentsWhen a calendar-based appointment is made for a non time-based resource pool,the required capacity should be specified. If a service resource is specified togetherwith the resource pool, capacity, service region and skill validations are performed.The required capacity is blocked against the specified service resource or resourcepool.Work Order Creation and Appointment Planning ExampleThe following example demonstrates the creation of a simple work order andappointment planning:A customer orders a TV with installation that requires a total of 2 hours, 0.5 houris fixed capacity and 1.5 hours variable capacity.The customer also orders a DVD player with installation that requires 1 hour offixed capacity and 0.5 hour of variable capacity. The sales person takes thecustomer's order, and creates a work order by selecting both installation servicelines (TV-Install and DVD-Install) and specifies the ship node as his own store.TV-Install and DVD-Install have the current work order field stamped withWorkOrderKey.Work Order is created with provider organization as the owner of the Ship Node.The requested capacity is 3 hours (sum of required quantities 2 and 1 hours). Thesales person checks for an appointment and offers available slots to the customer.The slot on November 12 from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM is selected. The appointmentstatus shown as Open, and the appointment is shown on the work order headerand both order lines (TV-Install and DVD-Install). Thus 3 hours of capacity isblocked between 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM on November 30 for specified resource poolwhich in this case is the retail store.Pre-Calling Before the Appointment DateWhen appointments are made for distant dates, it is preferred to make a pre-callcloser to the service date as a reminder to the customer. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation supports a sophisticated process for managing andmonitoring pre-calls which are not mandatory.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation supports confirming a appointmenteven when a pre-call attempt fails.When the service provider attempts to pre-call a customer, the pre-call could resultin one of the following: Successful Pre-Call — Occurs when a customer is reached during a pre-callattempt, and the customer confirms that the previously taken appointment isfine. Failed Pre-Call — Occurs when a customer could not be reached during apre-call attempt. However, an attempt may be made later to re-confirm theappointment with the customer. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationsupports confirming an appointment even if the pre-call attempt is unsuccessful. Change of Appointment — During a pre-call attempt, a customer may requestsfor a change in the appointment. Based on how distant in the future the newappointment is, another pre-call attempt may be made at a later point in timethat is closer to the new appointment."
Invoicing Provided Service and Delivery Services,"Provided and stand-alone delivery service invoicing is done based on the entireordered quantity on the sales order line.Delivery service with associated product lines are invoiced when the associatedproducts are invoiced. If the ordered quantity is the same as the quantity specifiedwhen creating the delivery service line, then the complete quantity is invoiced atthe same time as the product lines.For example, consider the following two cases:Case 1: Entered Quantity StrategyIf the entered quantity strategy is used to invoice delivery service lines withassociated product lines, the entire delivery service line quantity is invoiced whenthe product lines are invoiced.Consider that the product quantity is 10 and the quantity entered on the deliveryservice line is 5. The delivery service line is invoiced for its entire quantity whenproduct quantity is invoiced, regardless of whether the product quantity ispartially or completely invoiced.Case 2: Associated Quantity StrategyIf the associated quantity strategy is used to invoice delivery service lines withassociated product lines, the invoiced quantity on the delivery service lines iscomputed based on how much product quantity is invoiced.Consider that the product quantity is 10 and the delivery service line quantity is 5.The delivery service line is invoiced for 1 when the first 2 product units areinvoiced. In this case, the product quantity and the delivery service line quantitymaintain a ratio of 2:1 respectively"
Work Order Pipeline,"When modeling your business process, you can create pipelines for work orders. Apipeline consists of the different statuses a document goes through during its lifecycle. You can also set up transactions as they pertain to the pipeline that you areconfiguring.The Work Order document uses the value-added service pipeline. Work orders canalso be part of the scheduling activities in the order pipeline.Value-Added Services Pipeline for Work OrdersFrom its creation, a work order flows through a set of transactions and statusesuntil its completion. This chain of transactions and work order statuses is calledthe Value-Added Services (VAS) pipeline. You can configure the VAS Pipeline tomeet any special business requirements that you have. However, every VASgenerally begins with the transaction that creates the work order, and ends with atransaction when the work order is completed.A transaction is an occurrence that needs to be tracked and can call certain actionsto be performed. An order status describes what state work order is in.The following statuses may be used in a VAS pipeline, depending how it isconfigured within your system: Created - the work order is created Confirmed - the services in the work order are completed Cancelled - the request for services in the work order is cancelled"
Compliance Services,"Compliance services supply the ability to customize items for a buyer that meetthat buyer’s detailed specifications. For example, a vendor may supply arefrigerator that can be customized with a department store chain’s brand, BigStore. When the refrigerator is shipped, it has a small emblem that identifies itbeing the department store brand and all the supporting materials, such aswarranties and mail-in rebates, are specific to the department store, rather than theoriginal vendor.To support buyer compliance, the Requires_VAS_Compliance flag must be enabledin the Buyer Organization configuration. This indicates that the buyer may haveorders for items that are made to its specifications.When configuring information about the buyer, you can identify itemclassifications that should have a compliance service performed upon it. Thiscompliance service defines activities that should be performed to prepare the itemsin that item classification to meet the buyer’s requirements. Items which requirecompliance services to be performed can not be kits.For example, there may be a classification of ""Music CDs"". For all music CDs thatthis buyer purchases, a sticker advertising a new music service is applied to theCD case. When configuring the buyer to support this scenario, a complianceservice is created to describe how to apply the sticker. This compliance service isthen associated with the Item Classification ""Music CDs"" in the buyer’s complianceservices configuration.Configuring Compliance ServicesWhen configuring a compliance service, you can indicate whether work ordersshould be generated when the compliance service is performed. Under somecircumstances, the task to be performed may not effect the inventory scheduling orthe general processing, so a specific work order is not needed.Figure 39. VAS PipelineFor example, a buyer wants a mail-in-rebate coupon added to all CD players. Inthis case, the compliance service that describes this process may be configured sothat a specific work order is not generated because there is no change to theoverall inventory scheduling.In a different scenario, a shirt may be embroidered with a football team logo. Thisaffects available inventory and should be configured to generate a work order, bothto provide tracking for the processing, and to enable the use of the run numberoptimization of the compliance service processing. When the work order isgenerated for this service it is not reflected on the sales order. Also, if the workorder is cancelled, the change is not reflected back on the sales order. In caseswhen an order is released and an inventory check is required, the sales order isautomatically back ordered since the work order has been cancelled and noinventory is available. If an inventory check is not required in this case, the salesorder requires a manual change to back order.Using Run Quantity to Optimize Compliance ProcessingWhen a compliance service is configured, you can configure run quantity to controlyour processing of special items. A run quantity is used to calculate how many ofthe item should be created when there is insufficient inventory to meet an orderfor the item.When an order for an item that requires compliance services is placed, the systemtries to schedule against available inventory that has been set aside to fulfill thesespecial orders (or segmented) at the ship node specified on the order. If inventoryis not available at the ship node, the system tries to schedule against anysegmented inventory at configured procurement nodes. If there is still not enoughinventory to satisfy the order, a work order is created, based on the complianceservices for the item. This work order is used to manage the specific requirementsfor supplying the item.For example, Big Store purchases over 150 refrigerators each week. The complianceservice for those refrigerators is configured so 100 refrigerators should be madewhen a work order is created.Another buyer, Local Store, purchases 10 to 15 refrigerators a week. Whenconfiguring a compliance service for them, only 10 refrigerators should be createdwhen a new work order is created. The Table 30 summarizes the weekly purchasesand the configuration for the compliance service.If Big Store orders another 30 refrigerators, there is not enough inventory availableto supply them. A work order is created which specifies the steps for thecompliance service. The run quantity for the compliance service is 100, so a total of100 refrigerators are customized to the Big Store's requirements.If Big Store is having a sale and orders 150 refrigerators, a work order is created for200 refrigerators (two runs of 100 each). This occurs because only 21 refrigeratorsare onhand and when added to a run quantity of 100, only 121 refrigerators wouldbe available. Therefore the run quantity is used repeatedly to create enough tomeet the requirements of the order.When the ordered quantity is not equal to the run quantity, two inventory checksoccur during scheduling instead of one.If the Local Store orders another 7 refrigerators, no work order is created, and noadditional refrigerators are created. This completely depletes the stock of LocalStore refrigerator. If the Local Store orders 7 or more refrigerators, then anadditional 10 refrigerators are created."
What Is Supply Collaboration?,"Supply Collaboration coordinates and collaborates direct material supply plans,purchase orders, replenishment, inventory and inbound fulfillment across multiplebusiness units, division, suppliers, outsourced manufacturers and transportationproviders.Supply Collaboration involves managing the purchase order process for yourproducts."
Purchase Orders,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, a purchase order can be brokendown into three levels, the purchase order header level, purchase order line level,and purchase order release level. The purchase order header level contains all ofthe purchase order lines in a purchase order, the purchase order line level isbroken down by each individual purchase order line, and the purchase orderrelease level contains all of the lines that have been released to a ship node.A purchase order is made up of purchase order lines. A purchase order line isidentified by a unique item, unit of measure, and product class."
The Purchase Order Execution Pipeline,"Beginning from its creation, a purchase order flows through a set of transactionsand statuses until its completion. This chain of transactions and purchase orderstatuses is called the purchase order execution pipeline. There are two defaultpipelines the standard Purchase Order Execution pipeline for organizations thatown their nodes and the Drop Ship Purchase Order Execution pipeline fororganizations that use drop ship nodes for purchase order handling.A purchase order execution pipeline provides Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation with a means to perform actions, such as sending notifications orlogging alerts, dependent on the location of the purchase order in the pipeline. Italso provides you with a means to track a purchase order from creation tocompletion and perform any manual interventions, if necessary.The purchase order execution pipeline from which your business runs is unique tohow your system administrator has set up your business environment. However,every purchase order execution pipeline generally begins with a transaction thatcreates a purchase order and ends with a transaction that indicates a purchaseorder has been shipped.A transaction is an occurrence that needs to be tracked and can call certain actionsto be performed. A purchase order status describes what state a purchase order isin and moves it from transaction to transaction.Purchase Order StatusesThe following statuses may be used in a purchase order execution pipeline,depending how it is configured within your system: Accepted - The negotiated terms have been accepted by both parties and thepurchase order is ready to be released. Awaiting Chained Order Creation - A chained order must be created and sent tothe applicable node. Backordered - The purchase order has been created, but there is not enoughinventory to schedule it. The purchase order remains backordered untilinventory is available. Backordered From Node - The purchase order has been created and released tothe node, but the node does not have enough inventory to fulfill it. Being Negotiated - The purchase order is being negotiated in the negotiationpipeline. Cancelled - The purchase order has been canceled. Chained Order Created - A chained order has been created from the purchaseorder. Created - The purchase order has been created. Draft Order Created - A draft purchase order has been created in the CreatePurchase Order Console. All aspects of this order can be modified until it isconfirmed. Included In Shipment - The purchase order has been added to a shipment fordelivery. Receipt Closed - The necessary return handling for the purchase order has beencompleted and the return is closed. Received - The purchase order has been received by the Buyer. Received As Components - If an item in the purchase order consists of kitcomponents, this status indicates that the Buyer has received all components. Released - There is enough inventory to schedule to the purchase order forfulfillment. The purchase order is released to the Application Console, theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation Warehouse Management System, oranother third-party warehouse management system. Reserved - The purchase order has been created, but it is not ready to scheduleyet. Scheduled - The applicable node(s) have the inventory to fulfill the purchaseorder and can be scheduled for release. Sent to Node - The purchase order is sent in the form of an order release. Shipped - The purchase order has been shipped. Shipment Delayed - The all or part of the purchase order shipment has beendelayed. Shorted - The purchase order contains less quantity than requested. The order isclosed. Unreceived - The purchase order has not been received by the buyer. Unscheduled - The purchase order has been removed from Scheduled status andany inventory that has been reserved for the purchase order at the schedulednode(s) is canceled.The default pipeline and statuses can be configured according to your businesspractices. For more information about configuring purchase order executionpipelines and statuses, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: ApplicationPlatform Configuration Guide."
Payment Systems,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can be used to carry out the criticalpayment-related processes during order management processing and enables youto integrate with external payment processing systems.Payment processing involves payment authorization, settlement, and invoicing.This chapter describes the payment processing features, modules, components, andevents, related to authorization and settlement that occur at various times in theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation order lifecycle."
Payment Processing Overview,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the following paymentprocessing features: Multiple payment methods Synchronous payment processing Asynchronous payment processing External collection through accounts receivable User exits and APIs provided to handle customer logic Charge consolidation Pre-payments recorded Request amount returned Delayed reauthorization Charge transaction request identifiers Reverse authorization Pre-settlement support Invoicing Returns payment processing and refund fulfilment Exchange payment processing Draft order payment processing Manual interventions Multiple control levels Payment rulesMultiple Payment MethodsSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation enables you to associate an unlimitednumber of payment methods with an order. Furthermore, within a single paymenttype (such as credit cards), Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation permits anunlimited number of individual credit cards. For example, a specific order can bepaid for using a discount coupon, a gift check, and two credit cards.Synchronous Payment ProcessingThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation transactions and user exits can beconfigured to contact an external payment processing system synchronously andwait for the result of the authorization or charge request. Depending on the successor failure of the request, the payment status of the order is updated immediately.Asynchronous Payment ProcessingThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation transactions and user exits can beconfigured to communicate asynchronously with external payment processingsystems. The requests for authorization and charge then can be dispatched in abatch mode, and updates can be made all at once, based on the results of therequest. The payment status of the order in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation shows whether the request is still outstanding or has been processed.External Collection through Accounts ReceivableSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation permits integration with externalsystems that handle accounts receivable information. If this is enabled, all theinvoice details are published to the external accounts receivable system. Thesettlement process is not handled by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation.Any collections occurring outside Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation arenot reported back.User Exits and APIs Provided to Handle Custom LogicUser exits get invoked selectively, depending on payment type. User exits can becustomized to suit your needs. APIs have also been provided to enable customizedpayment processing.Charge ConsolidationCharge consolidation reduces the number of synchronous calls made to theexternal payment processing system. You set up a charge consolidation timeframewindow, based on each payment type defined for a seller. Later in productionmode, when similar requests for a particular order arrive within the specifiedtimeframe, they are grouped together and then the external call is made.Pre-Payments RecordedPayment authorizations and collections can be made on the front end and thencommunicated to Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation when the order getscreated. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can then record thesepre-authorized and pre-collected amounts. If these are only partial payments, theamount is deducted from the total order amount and then the typical paymentprocessing behavior continues for the remaining order amount.Request Amount ReturnedThe getOrderDetails API returns the request amount to be authorized on orders,including draft orders. The request amount equals the following subtracted fromthe total of the order: MaxChargeLimits of active payment methods Charges made with currently suspended payment methods The sum of any credits not tied to payment methodsPayment methods marked UnlimitedCharges = Y are counted as having a limit of0. If there are extra charges or authorizations on the order, the request amount maybe negative. For example, if an order has a total of $100, and the followingpayments, the request amount is $60 ($100-0-$30-$10): Gift card with a maximum charge limit of $30 Suspended credit card with a maximum charge limit of $20 ($10 charged) Credit card with unlimited chargesDelayed ReauthorizationThe delayed reauthorization feature controls the number of paymentreauthorizations that may occur when scheduling orders against backordered orpre-ordered inventory. While waiting for the ship date to approach, paymentauthorizations can expire and reauthorize several times, locking up customers’credit lines. This also costs money when interfacing with a payment gateway. Twodelayed reauthorization configuration options limit the number of reauthorizationsto configurable points in the order cycle.Delayed authorization is not supported for draft orders.Charge Transaction Request IdentifiersThe charge transaction request identifiers feature provides a mechanism to controlwhen payment authorizations occur on an order and the amount of theauthorization. Instead of authorizations being processed automatically at the orderlevel, this feature provides a finer granularity of control for authorizing paymentspertaining to orders. Authorizations are tied to identifiers, which represent anentity or group of entities in an order. For example, payment authorizations can beprocessed at the order release level or order line level, instead of only at the orderlevel, by creating request identifiers for either of the entities.The charge transaction request identifiers feature does not support the SettlementRequired payment option.Reverse AuthorizationSome credit card companies charge additional fees to merchants who do notexplicitly reverse an unused credit card authorization. The Reverse Authorizationfeature enables merchants to implement an authorization strategy to reverseunused authorizations before they expire. This feature also provides a way tohandle differing authorization and settlement amounts through user exits.Pre-Settlement SupportPre-settlement enables partial or complete charging of an order at any stage oforder processing. This is typically used in pre-ordering or store pick-up situationswhere the item has already been sold to the customer and has been set aside.Therefore, the collection process must be initiated before the actual shipment of theproduct.Named User ExitsYou can invoke a User Exit directly by implementing the new API calledinvokeUE. This is useful in situations where you need to invoke certain functionssuch as Fraud Check that are implemented as User Exits. The invokeUE API is theentry point to any application that wants to invoke a named User Exit. TheinvokeUE API internally calls the User Exit as specified in the input XML and willpass back the output of the User Exit to the caller. For more information aboutinvokeUE API, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs.Draft Order Payment ProcessingPayment processing can be enabled for draft orders by setting the Enable PaymentProcessing for Draft flag at the hub level. This allows processing of payments ondraft orders before the draft orders are confirmed. Additionally, the chargetransaction table and the payment status are populated when draft orders arecreated. This flag is on by default. Draft order payment processing includes thefollowing features: The processOrderPayment API accepts and persists new payment methods Displays error messages for failed authorizations Modifies failed payment methods Ignores charges on draft orders Perform payment processing based on charge sequences Consolidates charge transactionsThe processOrderPayment API Accepts and Persists NewPayment MethodsThe processOrderPayment API is enhanced to accept and persist new paymentmethods on orders. This allows uncharged and unauthorized payment methods tobe modified and deleted on the order.Displays Error Messages for Failed AuthorizationsError messages are returned in the processOrderPayments API output XML andstored in the YFS_PMNT_TRANS_ERROR table. To retrieve error messages afterpayment processing is completed, invoke the getOrderDetails API.Modifies Failed Payment MethodsIf a payment method on a draft order fails to authorize, the payment method canbe deleted or modified. In this case, the order payment status must be Failed andthe charge transaction status must be in error. To modify the payment method,change any of the attributes of the payment method, except payment key andpayment type.Ignores Charges on Draft OrdersWhen enabled, the Ignore Charge On Draft flag is used to ignore charge requestswhen calculating the request amount on a draft order. For example, if a draft ordertotaling $100 has a credit card authorization of $20 and check (charge request) for$20, the getOrderDetails API returns a request amount of $80. The Ignore ChargeOn Draft flag is turned off by default and configured at the hub level. The EnableDraft Order Processing flag must be set to On before you configure the IgnoreCharges On Draft flag.Performs Payment Processing Based on Charge SequencesIn the processOrderPayment API, the charge sequence for each payment methoddetermines the order in which authorizations and charges are processed on draftorders. By default, payment methods have equal charge sequences, and are thusprocessed in random order.Consolidate Charge TransactionsA charge transaction record is created each time an order is modified. For thisreason, many charge transaction records may exist for an order. TheconfirmDraftOrder API consolidates all charge transaction records for an order intoa single record.InvoicingThe invoicing process typically initiates the settlement process in the order lifecycle. Invoicing can be done either through time-triggered transactions or APIs.Shipment Invoicing occurs after the order has shipped. It initiates the collectionsprocess.Order Invoicing enables the settlement process to start at any stage of the lifecycleof an order, not just after shipment. This can be used in situations where there isno shipment or instances when the invoice needs to span multiple shipments.The Provided Service and Delivery Service is invoiced based on the orderedproduct line quantity. For more information, see “Invoicing Provided Service andDelivery Services” on page 216.Return invoicing enables refunds to be issued to the customer during the returnprocess. The refund can be configured to occur either before or after the receipt ofthe returned goods. If the return was created by a gift recipient, Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation does not issue the refund to the buyer on the salesorder, but to the gift recipient instead.Any modification to order taxes and changes during invoicing time will update theorder only when the order is completely invoiced. In addition, any modificationsto line taxes and changes on the line during invoicing time will update these orderlines only when the order line is completely invoiced.Invoices can be published immediately after creation (generally for externalcollections) or after settlement within Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation.Pro Forma InvoicingIn many business scenarios, if there are multiple shipments for each order, chargesand taxes are split up between the shipments. Depending on implementedbusiness processes, these amounts may be split amongst various shipments inseveral ways. To appropriately charge and tax subsequent shipments of an order,previous charges and taxes must exist in the database to be persisted against.A Pro Forma invoice, an invoice generated upon shipment creation, acts as draftinvoice that persists charges and taxes in the database so that when charges andtaxes are calculated for additional shipments, previous charges and taxes are takeninto consideration.For example, an order with two lines is created for $70. The enterprise usesincremental charges for shipping as follows: A $4.99 shipping charge is added to orders between $0 and $49.99 A $6.99 shipping charge is added to orders between $50 and $99.99Line1 on the order is $40, while Line2 on the order is $30. Without pro formainvoicing the following charges would occur upon invoicing:Cancelling Part of an Order with Pre-Collected PaymentsIf an order has not yet been shipped, but the payment for that order has alreadybeen pre-collected, cancelling all or part of the order could require a certainamount to be refunded. If that is the case, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation sends a notification that can be configured to be picked up by externalpayment systems with the amount refunded, if applicable.For example, if an order for $140 has $100 worth of pre-collected payments and$50 are cancelled, an amount of $10 needs to be refunded to the pre-collectedpayment type. In that case, a notification is raised by Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation for the $10 refunded.Additionally, the Deferred Credit On Return Required rule can be enabled in theApplications Manager at the payment rule level. If that rule is enabled, and if acancelled amount does not need to be refunded, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation sends a notification that can be configured to be picked up by externalsystems with that amount.If, in the above example, the Deferred Credit On Return Required rule is enabled,another notification is raised by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation for the$40 that was cancelled but not refunded.Price Changes Post InvoicingSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows for any charge or unit pricechange on an order to trigger the creation of adjustment invoices when the orderhas already been invoiced. This can be done by enabling the Apply Changes ToInvoiced Quantity rule at the document type level for a given enterprise. Theadjustment invoices are picked up by payment agents, and processed accordingly.For example, some stores offer their customers a lowest-price guarantee. If acustomer buys a pair of shoes for $50 and finds those same shoes at another storefor $45, then should request for a $5 refund. If the Apply Changes To InvoicedQuantity rule is enabled and the unit price of the shoes is changed to $45 on thesales order post invoice creation, an adjustment invoice is created for $5 and arefund is issued to the customer for that amount.Tax Changes Post InvoicingSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows for any change to the taxpercentage on an order to trigger the creation of adjustment invoices when theorder has already been invoiced. This can be done by turning on the ApplyChanges To Invoiced Quantity rule at the document type level for a givenenterprise. The adjustment invoices are picked up by payment agents, andprocessed accordingly.For example, if a customer with tax exempt status makes a purchase but neglectsto inform the store of his status until after the order has been shipped andinvoiced, an adjustment invoice is created and a refund is issued to the customer.When tax is applied on an order or an order line by passing tax percentage, the taxamount on the order, the order line, and the tax record are updated after invoicing.To reflect the correct tax amount on the order, the order line, and the tax record inthe output of order APIs before invoicing, the correct tax amount for thecorresponding tax percentage must be passed in the input or the recalculate taxuser exits must be implemented.Returns Payment Processing and Refund FulfillmentDuring the return process, the charges that have been collected from the consumermust be credited back to them. The refunded amount is credited back using theoriginal payment method.Refund SequenceIf a sales order had used several different payment methods, the charges arerefunded according to the refund sequence as defined in the Applications Manager.In the case of two or more payment methods having the same priority, the refundoccurs in reverse order of the payment sequence used in the sales order for thosemethods. This default sequence can be overridden by implementing theconfirmRefundPayments user exit.Pre-PaymentsWhen the return is derived from a sales order that contains some pre-paymentsand some regular payments, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation firstrefunds against its own payment methods. If by that point the full amount has notbeen refunded, it uses the pre-payment methods.Default Refund Payment TypeA default refund payment type can be defined so that if an order does not haveany valid payment methods for issuing a refund to, the refund is issued to a newpayment method of the default refund payment type. The default refund paymenttype can be overridden by implementing the confirmRefundPayments user exit.Refunding the Same AccountThe ’Refund to Same Account’ flag, as defined in the payment type level,indicates whether or not the payment should be refunded to the same account thatit was charged to, or create a new account. For example, if a customer placed anorder using a Stored Value Card and the flag is enabled, then the refund will bemade against that same Stored Value Card.Refunding Against a New Payment TypeIf the ’Refund to Same Account’ flag is disabled, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation tries to refund against a new payment type as defined in theApplications Manager. If you select the same payment type as the new paymenttype, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation refunds to the same paymenttype, but under a new account. For example, if a payment is made on a StoredValue Card when the ’Refund to Same Account’ flag is set to 'N' and the newpayment type is set to Stored Value Card, then the refund will be issued against anew Stored Value Card.If you do not want to create a charge request in YFS_CHARGE_TRANSACTIONtable, then a refund to a new payment type is created. In this case, the incompletecharge transaction is raised and human intervention is required to complete thecharge details for the payment type. Once the details are entered, the requestcollection agent picks up the charges that should be refunded and move it to thePAID status.Alternate Refund Payment Type with ConstraintThere are cases where a constraint should be placed on refunding against certainpayment types. For example, if a Stored Value Card costs the Enterprise $4 inproduction cost, and a refund amount is less than $5, the Enterprise may ratherissue a check. To achieve this, a payment type can be configured to have analternate refund payment type, which refunds are issued on when the refundamount satisfies the constraint.Refund Fulfillment OrderA refund fulfillment order is created by the Payment Collection transaction whenthe 'Create Refund Fulfillment Order Using' flag is enabled. When this flag isenabled, a refund fulfillment order is created instead of a new payment method.For example, a customer placed an order using a gift card and then returned theorder. Typically, the customer has a new gift card shipped to him in this case. Anew fulfillment order is automatically created to ship the gift card.Charge Instead of Authorize payment types will be refunded, even if settlement isnot required.Exchange Payment ProcessingWhen an exchange is created, the total order amount of the return order is addedto the PENDING_TRANSFER_IN field of the exchange order. This value is alwayskept synchronized on the exchange and the return order. For example, if anexchange is initially derived from a return order with a total amount of $40, and aline is later on added to the return that increases that amount to $60, thePENDING_TRANSFER_IN of the exchange is increased to $60 as well.For advanced and regular exchange orders, if the total amount on the exchangeorder exceeds the amount in PENDING_TRANSFER_IN, additional paymentinformation needs to be entered.A TRANSFER_IN charge record is created on the exchange order while aTRANSFER_OUT charge record is created on the order the amounts have beentransferred from.In the case of a pre-paid exchange, payment information has to be collected upfront for the entire amount of the exchange.Manual InterventionsIf required, users can override standard behavior, using a variety of UI controls,APIs, transactions, and user exits. Access to these manual activities can becontrolled through permissions configuration.Using manual interventions, customer service representatives can create creditmemos for refunds and debit memos for charges. Manual authorization and chargerequests can also be made. Orders can be put in a payment held status and thenreleased to continue processing. New payment methods can be added as needed.Existing payment methods can be suspended and re-activated. If the paymentmethod is suspended, all the other open authorization and charge requests createdfor this payment method are closed, and no new authorization or charge requestsare created for this payment method.Multiple Control LevelsPayment processing can be enabled or disabled at the document type level. Forexample, if payment processing is disabled for the Planned Order document type,no payment related activities occur for any orders belonging to that documenttype. Furthermore, payment processing can also be controlled at the seller level.Payment processing can be disabled for specific sellers so that their orders do notcarry out payment processing. The document type permission setting overrides theseller-level control setting.Payment RulesOne or more payment rules can be configured for the Seller organization. One ofthese rules should be set as the default payment rule for the Seller organization.Either a payment rule applicable to the order can be specified when creating theorder or the Seller's default payment rule is used for the order. The payment rulespecifies whether payment processing is done through accounts receivable orSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, the type of payment processing to bedone by the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation – Authorization orSettlement or both, and so on."
Payment Type Groups,Payment Type Groups refer to the method of tracking payment types that behavein the same manner. The available payment type groups are: Credit Card Customer Account Stored Value CardOther
Payment Types,"Payment types refer to the method of tracking payment-related information usedby the seller organization. The standard payment types provided are as follows: CREDIT_CARD CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT CHECK OTHERA seller organization can define any number of custom payment types. All of thepayment methods used in an order must be of payment types that have alreadybeen configured as valid payment types for that Seller.For each payment type, the charging sequence and the refund sequence can bespecified in the seller configuration. A charge sequence number (or refundsequence number) of 0 has the highest priority, followed by 1 and so on. Multiplepayment types can have the same sequence number. If the sequence is notspecified, all payment types are assumed to be of the same priority. The chargesequence and refund sequence are independent of each other.Payment MethodsPayment Methods contain the payment information specific to a payment type andare sent down with an order. They may also contain payment details pertaining topre-authorization or pre-charge information. Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation supports any number of payment methods to be passed in with eachorder.The following are the required fields for each payment type when it is used withina payment method in an order:One or more payment methods for an order can also be assigned chargingsequence. If the charge sequence is not specified for the payment methods or at theseller configuration level, all payment methods in the order has the same prioritywith regard to charging. The charge sequence of the payment method issubordinate to the sequence defined at the seller configuration level.A payment method can have unlimited charges assigned to it. If UnlimitedCharges = 'N', a Maximum Charge Limit can be set on it. Authorizations andcharges made on any payment method are subject to the limit set by the MaximumCharge Limit if Unlimited Charges = 'N' for that payment method. Any paymentmethod having Unlimited Charges = 'Y' is assigned the remaining amount ofauthorization/ charge on the order and any payment method below it in terms ofcharge sequence is ignored.A payment method in an order can be modified, suspended, or removed. Newpayment methods can also be added to an existing order. For detailed information,see the changeOrder() API in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs.Tokenization of Sensitive InformationBy default, credit card numbers and stored value card numbers are tokenizedinstead of being encrypted. Tokenization is the process of storing sensitiveinformation, such as a credit card number or stored value card number, in a vaultsystem that associates a token to the securely-stored sensitive information.The process of tokenization is enabled with the IBM Sterling Sensitive DataCapture Server application. Sterling Sensitive Data Capture Server interprets,validates, and tokenizes credit card numbers and stored value card numbers,enabling the IBM Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Suite to achieve PaymentApplication Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) compliance.For additional information about the Sterling Sensitive Data Capture Serverapplication and the tokenization of credit card numbers and stored value cardnumbers, refer to the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Sterling SensitiveData Capture Server, Release 1.1: Configuration Guide.For information about how to configure the Sterling Sensitive Data Capture Serverapplication for PCI-DSS compliance, refer to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide.Charging SequenceThe charging sequence determines the sequence in which Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation creates authorization or charge requests. The logic is asfollows:Each payment method on the order is assigned an Actual Charge Sequence basedon which authorization and charge requests are created. The requests are createdagainst the payment methods in the ascending order of the payment type'sconfigured charge sequence as defined in the seller configuration and then thepayment method's transactional charge sequence as defined in the specific order.For example, in this scenario, the charge sequence for the seller is specified asfollows: 0 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT 1 for CREDIT_CARD 2 for OTHERThe payment methods in the order are specified to use the following chargesequence: 1 for CreditCard1 2 for CustomerAccount1 3 for Other1 4 for CreditCard2This results in these payment methods charged in the following sequence:1. CustomerAccount12. CreditCard13. CreditCard24. Other1Also note the following behavior regarding charging: The requests created do not exceed the Max Charge Limit specified on thePayment methods. If a particular payment method is not valid (information incomplete), the systemskips that payment method and creates charges against lower priority paymentmethods in the order. Authorization and Charge requests are not created against suspended paymentmethods. If the payment methods on the order are not sufficient to cover the requiredfunds, the order rolls back to the AWAIT_PAY_INFO status. At this point in theprocess, thePAYMENT_COLLECTION.INCOMPLETE_PAYMENT_INFORMATION eventcan be raised.Refund SequenceThe refund sequence determines the sequence in which Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation creates negative charge or refund requests. The logic itfollows is described below.1. The refund requests are created against the payment methods in the order ofthe 'Actual Refund Sequence'. The requests are created against the paymentmethods in the ascending order of the payment type's configured refundsequence as defined in the seller configuration and then the descending orderof the payment method's transactional charge sequence as defined in thespecific order.2. The refund requests are created only against payment types that are marked asVALID_FOR_RETURN. If a payment method is suspended, it is not consideredfor refund. The steps involved in determining the refund amount are:a. In the first parse of the order's payment methods, the refund against apayment method does not exceed the total charge against the paymentmethod.b. After the first parse finishes, there could still be some refund that needs tobe issued for which a valid payment method, that has the relevant fundscharged against it, could not be found. For this extra refund amount, thefollowing logic is applied: If the ""PAYMENT->EXCEED_CHARGE_AMOUNT_FOR_REFUND"" ruleis set as Y (a document type or rule set level definition), the first priority(lowest Actual_Refund_Sequence) payment method on the order ischosen to issue all remaining credit.c. Even the above option might fail if there are NO payment methods on theorder that are valid for return. In this case, the payment Type, marked asDefault For Return, is created for the order and the refund is issued againstthis payment type. If this payment type requires more information to makeit complete, an INCOMPLETE_PAYMENT_INFORMATION event is raised.If both the above fail (there is no Default_For_Return payment type), then anINCOMPLETE_PAYMENT_INFORMATION event is raised. For more informationabout refund fulfillment, see “Returns Payment Processing and RefundFulfillment” on page 231."
Payment Status,"Each order has a payment status, such as AUTHORIZED, INVOICED, or PAID.This status is associated with the order. Payment status can have one of thefollowing values: AWAIT_PAY_INFO - The payment information was not available at ordercreation or during authorization or charging. An order can also go to this state ifthe provided payment methods are insufficient to cover the order amount or theamount to be refunded.AWAIT_AUTH - Part of the order amount is pending authorization. REQUESTED_AUTH - The authorization request has been sent, but a reply hasnot been received from the payment system. This status only occurs inasynchronous environments. REQUESTED_CHARGE - A charge request has been sent, but a reply has notbeen received from the payment system. This status only occurs in asynchronousenvironments. AUTHORIZED - The order amount is less than or equal to the authorizedamount. When delayed reauthorization is configured, a status of AUTHORIZEDindicates that the order can move through the pipeline, but may not indicate fullauthorization. See “Delayed Reauthorization” on page 241 for more information. INVOICED - The order is invoiced completely and there is no open orderamount. PAID - The payment was collected for the order. FAILED_AUTH - An authorization request failed. FAILED_CHARGE - A charge request failed. NOT_APPLICABLE -Either the document type of the order does not requirepayment processing, or the seller organization does not require paymentprocessing."
General Payment Process,"Payment processing in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation consists of twosub-processes - Authorization and Settlement.Authorization ProcessPayment Authorization is a process through which the amount to be paid on apayment method is verified. In case of credit cards, authorization specificallyinvolves contacting the payment system and blocking the required amount offunds against the credit card. Payment types may or may not require thisauthorization step. This is configurable in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation in the sellers payment rule. Note that if an order requires paymentprocessing, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation does not pick up the orderfor scheduling or other processing until it is authorized.The Payment Collection time-triggered transaction analyzes an order to createauthorization requests. The Payment Execution time-triggered transaction monitorsrequests created for authorization and provides user exits to carry out theauthorization. The user exit can process the authorization request in any one of thefollowing ways: Perform synchronous processing to carry out the authorization immediately byinterfacing to an accounts receivable database, and pass back the authorizedamount. Place a request to try again later if the interface to the payment system isinoperable.Request asynchronous processing, which means that Console never contacts thepayment system for this order.Depending on the response from the external payment system, different events canbe raised to handle the response appropriately within Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation. For more details on the available events, see the paymentprocessing APIs in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs.Once authorization is received, or the order is pre authorized on the front end forthe complete order amount, the Payment Collection transaction changes thepayment status to AUTHORIZED.Expiration DateEach authorization has an attached expiration date. At a fixed number of days(=Expiration for Authorization, which is configurable) before the authorizationexpires, a reauthorization request is automatically created by the PaymentCollection time-triggered transaction. For example, if an order expires on 4/15, andthe fixed number of days is 4, then the reauthorization request is created on 4/11.Charge Transaction Request IdentifiersThe charge transaction request identifiers configuration option, which is accessiblefrom the Payment Rule screen, provides customers with a finer granularity ofauthorization control on an order. Instead of payment authorizations beingprocessed at only the order level, this configuration option enables paymentauthorizations to be based on predefined order groupings. Each grouping in theorder has a charge transaction request identifier associated to the grouping.Note: The charge transaction request identifiers feature does not support theSettlement Required payment option.Two hang-off tables, YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_REQUEST andYFS_CHARGE_TRAN_RQ_MAP, manage the grouping requests of authorizationpertaining to an order. YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_REQUEST contains the requests forauthorizations and identifiers, and YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_RQ_MAP maps therequests to charge transactions.Sequence of Authorization Requests: Each authorization request contains aMaxRequestAmount attribute, which defines the total authorization required forthat request. When a request is fully authorized, the authorization for the nextrequest begins. A sequence may be specified for the requests; otherwise, therequests are executed in the order of their request identifiers.Payment Status: Each authorization request has a payment status associated withthe request. The payment status can have a value of AWAIT_AUTH,REQUEST_AUTH, FAILED_AUTH, or AUTHORIZED. The default payment statusis AWAIT_AUTH. When the payment status of a request identifier changes, thePAYMENT_COLLECTION.REQUEST_PAYMENT_STATUS event is fired.The payment status on a request is computed in the same way as the paymentstatus on an order.Reversal of AuthorizationIn addition to normal transaction fees that credit card companies charge, they mayalso charge an extra fee to merchants who do not explicitly reverse an unusedcredit card authorization. The Reverse Authorization feature enables merchants toimplement an authorization strategy that generates a reversal request before theunused authorization expires.Credit card companies may also levy a fee if the authorization amount and thesettlement amount do not match. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides a means of reversing expiring authorizations and handling differentauthorization and settlement amounts through the YFSCollectionCreditCardUEuser exit implementation. Reverse authorization requests are processed by thePAYMENT_EXECUTION agent.With the exception of customer accounts, the reverse authorization featuresupports any payment method that requires authorizations.Authorization Reversal Window: During the credit card authorization process, amerchant seeks authorization for an order by contacting a payment system andthen blocking the credit card for the settlement amount. Typically, as thisauthorization expires, it automatically seeks reauthorization. However, if reverseauthorization is enabled, in addition to seeking reauthorization, an authorizationrequest is created for the same authorization ID, only in a negative amount. Forexample, an expiring authorization for $100 would initiate another authorizationfor $-100.While the credit card company and the bank influence when the expiration occursand when the reversal period ends, you can define an authorization reversalwindow based on your business metrics. These metrics might include the volumeof throughput you have to the payment system, how often order modification ispermitted, the percentage of orders against future inventory, and how often yourun payment collection agents.Figure 42 illustrates a typical authorization life cycle and where the reversalwindow might be in that life cycle.In Figure 42, a reverse authorization can occur any time from the start ofAuthorization Acquired to the end of the Reversal Window. The ideal point ofreversal for an authorization is as close to the end of this reversal period aspossible, so that you can head off extra fees, but not too early in this reversalperiod, as this will incur additional costs.If you are reversing authorizations, set the expiration date in theYFSCollectionCreditCardUE to the point shown in Figure 42, not the actualauthorization expiration date. As a result, the system will start trying to reverse theauthorization at this point, when there is still time to reasonably process a reverseauthorization and to retry if the first attempt fails.If you are not reversing authorizations, set the expiration date to the actualexpiration date.Figure 42. Authorization Window of ReversalIn some implementations and for some credit cards, the reversal window maydiffer from the one depicted in Figure 42 on page 239. The period ""Valid But MayNo Longer Reverse"" may not exist because it might be possible to reverse anauthorization right up to the actual expiration date without incurring extra fees.Configuration Options: Two reverse authorization configuration options aredescribed in this section. These are available in the Payment Type Details windowof the Distributed Order Management Applications Manager, as described in theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Distributed Order ManagementConfiguration Guide: Do not reverse Reverse when expiredDo Not ReverseYou can select this option if you do not want to implement an authorizationreversal strategy. This means that the normal authorization life cycle occurs;authorizations are acquired, then after a period of time, they expire. At expiration,new authorizations are acquired. No reversals are involved.Reverse When ExpiredIf this option is enabled, reverse authorization occurs automatically in the form ofan authorization request for the same authorization ID, only in a negative amount.For example, if the original authorization was for $60, the reverse authorizationrequest is for -$60.If you have enabled automatic reversal of authorization and the specific paymentmethod does not support reverse authorization, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation marks the authorization for reversal but does not contact the paymentsystem and incur any cost.Reverse Authorization Settlement Scenarios: Three settlement scenarios followfor reversal of authorization. Authorization amount and settlement charge match Expired authorization Authorization and settlement amount differAuthorization Amount and Settlement Charge MatchIn most scenarios, a settlement request will be created for an authorization that hasnot yet expired and for the exact amount. In this situation, there is no need forreversal or reauthorization, and the settlement can occur normally against theintended authorization.Expired AuthorizationIt is possible for a charge request to be created while an authorization request hasexpired, but before it can be reauthorized. In this instance, there is no need toreverse the authorization. If the authorization expiration date is set to the last datewhen reversal is allowed, then the authorization is likely still valid for settlement.You can use executeCollection’s user exits such as YFSCollectionCreditCardUE todetermine how the charge should be processed. You can determine the actualauthorization date based on the payment type information indicating how far inadvance a payment type must be reversed.If the authorization is actually expired, then the YFSCollectionCreditCardUE canreturn that the charge has failed and requestCollection would create a new chargerequest, returning the results in executeCollection. Inside the output of the userexit is a field in recordAdditionalTransactions that you can use to record additionalpayment system communication that occurs inside the YFSCollectionCreditCardUEuser exit, which typically updates only a single record. The executeCollection APIwill use this document to call the recordExternalCharges API internally. If thereauthorization or settlement fails, then YFSCollectionCreditCardUE returns thatthe charge has failed and requestCollection will create a new charge request.Authorization Amount and Settlement Charge DifferWhen settling an invoice, an authorization request may not match the actualcharge request. This mismatch can occur if there is a partial shipment, a pricechange, or other adjustment scenarios. For example, a charge for $60 might takeplace on an authorization for $100. If this happens, use the following strategy:1. Reverse the original authorization of $100.2. Acquire a new authorization for $60.3. Settle against the new authorization for $60.You can implement this strategy inside the YFSCollectionCreditCardUE. and reportany necessary information via the recordAdditionalTransactions output field. Youmay also update the authorization ID of the charge record, but you must providereverse and reauthorization information using recordAdditionalTransactions.Manual Adjustment of Authorizations:You may choose to minimize mismatched settlements by reversing authorizationsfor order modifications and invoices. Depending on the frequency of total ordermodifications, this may save transaction fees. Tax and charge adjustment duringinvoicing can also be a candidate for reversal and reauthorization, as these occurright before settlement.To accomplish manual adjustment, an open authorization reversal request can becreated using the recordExternalCharges API; a reauthorization should not becreated at this time. With the reversal created, the payment agents will create thereauthorization automatically for the correct amount.Delayed ReauthorizationWhen an order is awaiting inventory, authorizations can expire and triggermultiple reauthorizations that lock up the customer’s credit line and cause expenseto the seller. To reduce the cost of these transactions, configurable payment rulesoffer the following delayed reauthorization choices: Delay of Reauthorization - Delay reauthorization after the initial authorizationhas been created. When the initial authorization expires, no reauthorizationsoccur until a configurable number of hours before the release date. Schedule without Authorization - Forego the initial authorization and wait untila configurable number of hours before the release date to perform anauthorization.Both configuration options are accessible on the Payment Rule screen.Release Date: The release date, which is when notice is sent to the warehouse torelease the order, drives the timing of the final authorization. This is not the sameas the ship date, when an order ships. Scheduling a final authorization hoursbefore the release date guarantees that lines will not be released or shipped untilauthorization takes place.Bundles: Bundle parents will be priced for authorization similar to Invoicingwhen the ""Invoice on first bundle component"" rule is selected. For moreinformation on Invoicing, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Distributed Order Management Configuration Guide.PS and DS Work Orders: Service lines use the Promised Appointment Start Date,rather than the release date, for determining the authorization date. Product itemson a work order still use the release date.Procurement, Transfer, and Chained Orders: Procurement, Transfer, and ChainedOrders can begin without authorization.Order Modifications: Any modifications that affect the payment related entitieson an order cause the order payment status to change to AWAIT_AUTH. Examplesof these changes include changing a payment method, increasing line quantitybecause of adding a new line or increasing the quantity on a line, and changing aprice, charges, and taxes. After these modifications, the Payment Collectiontransaction evaluates the order again and determines the appropriate course ofaction.When delayed reauthorization is configured, order modifications include anytransaction or API that: Changes the price of an order (except shipment adjustments and final invoiceson a shipment) Changes the expected ship date Changes the expected appointment date of PS/DS linesPayment Status: If authorization is required before scheduling, the entire orderthat is not covered by an active authorization will be reauthorized. If the paymentrule requires authorization before scheduling and the price change is positive(increases), the payment status becomes AWAIT_AUTH.If authorization is not required before scheduling, the payment status will remainAUTHORIZED until the order is ready for release.Note: When delayed reauthorization is configured, a payment status ofAUTHORIZED on an order awaiting inventory may not indicate full authorization.For example, if a $100 order for Item 1 and Item 2 is initially authorized, but Item1 ships immediately for $60 and Item 2 is delayed by three weeks, the initialAUTHORIZED status for $100 does not necessarily constitute authorization for theremaining $40 after the authorization expires. This AUTHORIZED status does,however, keep the item or order moving through the order process until release,when final authorization occurs.Settlement ProcessPayment settlement involves collecting the funds for the amount recorded for anorder. For example, when using credit cards, the settlement process specificallyinvolves contacting the payment system and collecting the required amount offunds against the credit card. Payment types may or may not require thissettlement step. This is configurable in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationin the seller's payment rule. Note that if an order requires payment processing, it isnot purged unless settlement is completed and order is in PAID status. For moredetails on the available events, see the payment processing APIs in the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs.Payment Collection analyzes orders to create settlement requests. A settlementrequest is a request for Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation to complete asettlement. If the payment rule applicable for the order requires both authorizationand settlement, the settlement requests are created only against existing,non-expired authorizations.If settlement is handled through an external collections system, you may choosenot to record payment collections through accounts receivable. If settlement is notrecorded in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation database, a settlementrequest is not created for the order. It is assumed that settlement is performedthrough an external system using the information published with the invoice.Payment Execution monitors settlement requests. This time-triggered transactionprovides user exits to carry out the settlement. The user exits can process thesettlement request in one of the following ways: Carry out the settlement immediately (interfacing to an accounts receivabledatabase) and pass back the settlement amount. Place a request to try again later if the interface to the payment system isinoperable. Request asynchronous processing, which means that Console never contacts thepayment system for this order. The payment interface (custom extension) mustupdate details corresponding to payment through the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation APIs. This is typically the case when interfaces to thepayment system are run in batch mode.The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation time-triggered transactions changethe payment status of the order to PAID once payment is received for the completeorder amount."
Customer Account Payment Process,"When customer accounts are set up within the system, payment processing fororders belonging to these customer accounts differs from that for the GeneralPayment Process.A customer account can be set up in the system by setting the Customer AccountMaintained Internally flag for the payment rule, and setting the account limit forthat customer account. For this functionality to work effectively, the Hold To BeApplied Due To Insufficient Funds In Customer Account rule should beconfigured. Besides this, the deprecated functionality of hold types should not beon. For more information about hold type, see “Order Hold Processing” on pageAuthorization ProcessWhen a customer account is maintained, neither is the external system contactedfor authorization nor is the YFSCollectionCustomerAccountUE user exit called forAUTHORIZATION requests. The system checks how much funds are available inthe customer account. If the requested amount is less than or equal to the availableamount in the customer account, the AUTHORIZATION request is closed and theOpen Authorization amount against that customer account is increased. If therequested amount is unavailable, the hold configured in the Applications Manager,Hold To Be Applied Due To Insufficient Funds In Customer Account is applied tothe order. The requested amount is added back to the customer account fornegative authorization requests.Payment Processing In Case of Insufficient FundsOrders are on hold when there are insufficient funds in the account. The hold isdetermined by the rules configured in the system. When the orders that are onhold gets authorized, the hold is removed.To make the orders that are on hold eligible for reauthorization: Manually Override AuthorizationIn exceptional scenarios, the order is processed even if sufficient funds are notavailable. The book amount for the customer account is increased and the totalamount of the order is considered as processed amount. Change Customer Account LimitA customer may request the enterprise to increase the account limit. When thecustomer account limit is increased, the orders that could not be processedearlier should be revisited.The triggerRequestCollection API is provided to trigger payment processing ofsuch orders that are on hold. This API should be called on change of customeraccount limit. Reduce Open Order AmountThe Open Order Amount for a customer account may get reduced when anauthorized order for that customer account is cancelled, or when an order issettled either internally or externally.The triggerRequestCollection API is provided to trigger payment processing ofsuch orders that are on hold. This API should be called on the success of thechange order. Settlement of Customer Account OrdersWhen customer account orders are settled, the execution of open orders occurs.The triggerRequestCollection API is provided to trigger payment processing ofsuch orders that are on hold. This API should be called on change of customeraccount balance.Expiration DateThe authorization acquired for customer accounts do not have an expiration date.Settlement ProcessThe payment settlement process involves collecting funds for the amount recordedfor an order. The settlement process for orders pertaining to the customer accountsmaintained internally is almost the same as that for the general paymentprocessing settlement process. For more information about General PaymentProcess, see “Settlement Process” on page 242. The only difference in thesettlement process for internally maintained customer accounts is that the openorder amount on those accounts gets reduced by the settled amount."
Payment Processing Transactions,"The following standard time-triggered transactions enable Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation to exchange financial information with external systems: Create Order Invoice - Creates one or more invoices for an order. It is a derivedtransaction and is recommended to be used in scenarios where invoices are notlinked to shipments (such as Return). Create Shipment Invoice - Creates one or more invoices for the shipment. It is aderived transaction and is recommended to be used to create invoices againstshipments. Payment Execution - Processes all requests that are pending authorization andcharging. It reads all open requests for authorization and charges and invokesthe appropriate user exits for executing the request. Payment Collection - Analyzes the orders and determines the amount for whichan authorization or charge request(s) should be created. Send Invoice - Publishes invoice data that can be directed to external accountsreceivable systems. The invoice can be published when it is created or after thepayment has been collected.For more information about these time-triggered transactions, see the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide."
Using Custom Transactions,"If your business needs require additional financial-related integration with externalsystems, you can write custom time-triggered transactions. When writing customtime-triggered transactions, invoke any of the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation payment-related user exits and APIs.Payment-Related APIsThe following APIs enable integration with external financial systems: executeCollection() - Processes individual requests for authorization andcharging in the order the requests were created. If you need to process requestsindividually, you can call this API to carry out individual requests as required.This API calls the appropriate user exit to carry out payment processing. recordCollection() - Records the authorization and charging amounts processedfor individual requests created by Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation.This is useful when you want to interface with external payment processingsystems in a batch mode to process a group of requests and then update SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation with the results. processOrderPayments() - Invokes the requestCollection() API andexecuteCollection() API in a single call, which allows for online authorization ofan entire order amount in order to avoid unnecessary expenses. TheprocessOrderPayments() API takes a list of payment methods on the order. executePaymentTransactions() - Processes requests for authorization andcharging before creating or confirming an order. Multiple payment requests areauthorized or charged in the order the requests are made. This API verifiespayment conditions before calling the appropriate user exit to carry out paymentprocessing. If the API encounters an error during verification, it terminates theprocess without calling the user exit. If an error occurs while the user exit isprocessing, the API terminates the user exit and returns all successful paymenttransactions up to and including the first failed transaction. scheduleOrder() - Calculates when orders should be reauthorized. getOrderDetails() - Returns detailed information about a specific order numberfrom the transaction or history tables. Information includes OrderLines,PriceInfo, OverallTotals, ChargeTransactionDetails, OrderStatus, and otherorder-related information. recordExternalCharges() - Records any authorizations and charging carried outexternal to Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. This API is also used torecord a payment received by an external system. An example is a buyeraccount that receives payment after a considerable period of time. TheexecuteCollection API would have previously notified Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation that this charge is being processed asynchronously, thenthe recordExternalCharges API records the actual charge. requestCollection() API - Analyzes the order and determines the amount forwhich an authorization or charge request should be created. recordInvoiceCreation() - Records credit memos, debit memos or informationalinvoices against an Order. When a credit memo or debit memo is recorded usingthis API, it acts as a trigger for Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation toinvoke settlement processes for the amount being invoiced. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation does not do any payment processing for informationalinvoices created through this API. These invoices can be used to capture carrierclaims and so forth which are actually processed through an external system butare recorded against the order for visibility purposes. createAccessToken - Generates a random and unique access token. This is usedto authenticate calls to the Sterling Sensitive Data Capture Server application. manageChargeTransactionRequest and getChargeTransactionRequestList - TheseAPIs manage the authorization process for the charge transaction requestidentifiers associated with an order. The getChargeTransactionRequestList APIretrieves the charge transaction requests for authorization. ThemanageChargeTransactionRequest API also resets the authorization expirationdate on the order to sysdate, which, in turn, enables the requestCollection API todetermine the amount for which the authorization or charge request should becreated. Each API call can simultaneously process multiple charge transactionrequests for an order.For more information about these APIs and the events raised by them, see theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs.Payment-Related User ExitsThe following user exits are called by the Payment Execution time- triggeredtransaction and the executeCollection() API: YFSCollectionCreditCardUE - Processes authorization and charging against acredit card. YFSCollectionCustomerAccountUE - Processes authorization and chargingagainst a buyer account. YFSCollectionOthersUE - Processes authorization and charging against any othermethod of payment such as gift checks or discount coupons. YFSgetFundsAvailableUE - Enables a user to plug in external logic to determinethe funds available on a payment method for an order. YFSCollectionStoredValueCardUE - Provides the option of plugging in customlogic to authorize or charge a stored value card."
Database Details,"The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation database holds payment datamainly in six tables, YFS_CHARGE_TRANSACTION, YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_DIST,YFS_ORDER_HEADER, YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_REQUEST,YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_RQ_MAP, and YFS_PMNT_TRANS_ERROR.The system uses the YFS_CHARGE_TRANSACTION table as the driver table tointerface with the time-triggered transactions for processing authorizations andcharges. The driver table also serves as the journal for all credits and debits againstthe order at any time.YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_DIST TableThis table contains records for pre-collected funds that are being refunded. It alsocontains the keys of the pre-collected charge transactions (transfer in, charge), thecharge transactions to which it was refunded (transfer out, negative charge), andthe amount refunded.YFS_ORDER_HEADER TableThe key field related to payment processing in the YFS_ORDER_HEADER table isPAYMENT_STATUS. See “Payment Status” on page 236.YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_REQUEST TableThis table contains the requests for payment authorization and identifiers. Thecombination of the ORDER_HEADER_KEY and the identifier creates a set ofunique groups for the order. Authorizations will be split such that eachauthorization is for only one identifier.YFS_CHARGE_TRAN_RQ_MAP TableThis table maps the charge transaction requests to the charge transactions fillingthem.YFS_PMNT_TRANS_ERROR TableThis table contains a set of error messages obtained from the user exit outputduring payment processing. When records for a charge transaction are removed,any transaction error associated to the charge transaction must also be removed.This applies to the changeOrder() API, deleteOrder() API, and thePurgeOrderAgent."
What Is Logistics Management,"Logistics Management involves planning and monitoring order line level shippingprocesses so that an order is shipped when and how a customer wants it to beshipped. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides a number of featuresthat support inbound compliance with buyer's shipping requirements,consideration of the preferences of an Enterprise, and the ability to customize theshipping processes."
Planning Considerations for Shipping,"When planning to ship one or more order lines, the goals include: Delivering the items in a cost-effective way Meeting any requirements of the customer for shipping. For example, ensurethat orders from different departments within the same organization are shippedindividually to each department Deliver the items in a timely fashionIn practice, creating an effective plan for shipping depends on a large number ofpractical considerations. Often, there is a trade-off between the speed of deliveryand the cost of delivery. The enterprise which is shipping items often attempts tominimize the number of shipments and loads that are sent, while the buyer isconcerned with receiving shipments in a form that is convenient for the buyer'sinternal processes.With Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, you can establish how theseshipping planning considerations should be assessed. Using Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation, you can increase the efficiency of your delivery planningby establishing conditions and processes for interacting with your buyers."
Terms,"The following are some of the key terms used in shipping planning:CarrierThe carrier is provider of the delivery service. Multiple carriers can be involved indelivering items that are part of an order.Delivery planA delivery plan is a complete sequence of movements needed to deliver one or moreorders from one or multiple origins to one or multiple destinations. A deliveryplan is comprised of shipments, loads, origins, stops, and destinations.DestinationThe destination is the last node or address in the travel route of a load where allremaining shipments in the load are dropped off.LoadA load carries one or more complete shipments (never a partial shipment) betweentwo points. A load has one origin and one destination, but it can have multipleintermediate stops. Shipments can be added to a load at its origin or anyintermediate stop and can be dropped off at the load destination or anyintermediate stop.OriginThe origin is the node the load originally ships from.ShipmentA shipment is a delivery of one or more orders and order lines from a singleshipper to a single consignee. A shipment can be carried through multiple loadsand by multiple carriers.StopA stop is any location where a shipment is picked up or dropped off. A load has astop sequence that determines its travel route.Shipment Planning StrategiesWhen planning, you want to deliver items cheaply, quickly, and honor therequirements of your customer. The following strategies are used to accomplishthese delivery planning goals.Consolidation of Items into a ShipmentIt is often more efficient to ship several items from an order in one shipment. If allof the items are being shipped to the same location, it often cheaper to ship themtogether in a single shipment.Consolidation of Shipments into a LoadShipments can be batched together in a single load that is transported by thecarrier. When consolidating shipments into a load, many factors should beconsidered:v possible routesv available carriersv freight capacity of the carriersv special requirements of either intermediate nodes or the customerFor example, there could be a low cost bulk carrier available, but the containersthat are used by that carrier are too large for the receiving dock of the customer.Optimize RoutingDepending on the circumstances, different routing strategies can be used tooptimize delivery time and delivery costs. In some situations, a direct route fromthe sender is best. In other cases, picking up multiple shipments, and deliveringthem to single destination makes the most sense."
Shipment Planning Features,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides many features to provideflexible shipment planning. You can establish conditions that control howconsolidation of shipments, creation of loads and routing are performed. Theseconditions are established for the Enterprise, and can also be established for eachBuyer organization. You can then establish the conditions of the organization thatshould take precedence if there are any conflicting conditions.Key delivery planning features include: Using economic shipping parameters Determining routingIn addition, you can explicitly establish how your shipments are routed, usingmanual routing. See “Delivery Plans” on page 260.Using Economic Shipping ParametersConsolidating two or more shipments and shipping them together strengthens thepotential to bring about significant savings in transportation cost. This also bringsabout a trade-off between the cost savings made through consolidated orders andthe ability to stick to the delivery dates.Economic Shipping Parameters (ESP) settings are used to assess the said trade-offbetween: Holding a shipment until many items are available to ship together, and Shipping in a timely fashionShipments can be held in two ways:1. Multiple orders are available at a given time, and the orders are consolidatedinto a single shipment to reduce costsa. Multiple orders with the same ship dateb. Multiple orders with different ship dates2. An existing order is held in anticipation of another order to enableconsolidationScenario 1-A: Multiple orders available at a given time with thesame ship dateThis is an ideal scenario where all the available orders can be consolidated into oneshipment, without compromising the delivery dates.This is possible as all the orders share the same ship date.Scenario 1-B: Multiple orders available at a given time withdifferent ship datesIn this scenario, there may be a trade-off in meeting the delivery dates for theorders. The ESP settings come into effect to keep the delays within acceptablelimits.In a scenario where two or more orders in this set of orders are spaced beyond themaximum number of days specified in the ""Allow shipment delay"" parameter orthe applicable shipping window (the range of dates within which the order mustbe shipped), only the applicable orders are consolidated together.For example, if the Ship By dates of orders O1, O2, and O3 are spaced by one dayeach (D1, D2, and D3), and the allow shipment delay parameter is set to one day,the ESP consolidates either order O1 and O2, or O2 and O3, and not all three. Thisis because the two-day gap between the Ship By dates of orders O1 and O3 ismore than the allowed shipment delay.Scenario 2: An existing order is held in anticipation of anotherorder to enable consolidationThe one order/shipment available for shipping is held optimistically, inanticipation of another order to the same Ship To Address.The ESP settings determine how long the order can be held, before it has to bereleased for further processing. As per the ESP settings, the orders are typicallyheld until they fulfil the weight or volume thresholds, or complete the maximumnumber of days specified in the ""Allow shipment delay"" parameter, or theshipments' shipping window.Shipments' shipping window refers to the window within which a shipment has tobe shipped, and is bound by the ""Requested Ship Date"" on the shipment and the""must ship before date"".The ""must ship before date"" is computed as follows:Step 1 Ascertaining customer requested ship dateIf a Customer Requested Ship Date exists for the order, it is used.If a Customer Requested Ship Date is not available for the order, then one of thefollowing methods is used:v If the order has a Requested Delivery Date, the Customer Requested Ship Dateis computed by subtracting the Global Transit Time from the Requested DeliveryDate, and based on the ""End of Shift"" parameter using the end of shift of theresulting date.v If Requested Delivery Date is not specified on the order, the current time isassumed as the Customer Requested Ship Date.Step 2 Calculating Must Ship Before DateAfter the Customer Requested Ship Date has been ascertained, the Must ShipBefore Date is calculated using the following formula:MustShipBeforeDate = Min (Max (ReqShipDate, CustReqShipDate + ESPDelayDays),ReqCancelDate))where, MustShipBeforeDate is the date before which a shipment must be shipped, ReqShipDate is the earliest ship date as requested by the customer, CustReqShipDate is the date as ascertained in step 1. ESPDelayDays are the number of days the shipment can be delayed from theearliest of the requested ship dates on the orders that make up the shipment.The ESP Delay Days is taken from buyer's inbound compliance or enterprise'soutbound constraints or HUB's outbound constraints based on configuration forthe freight terms on the order, and based on who maintains ESP parameters. ReqCancelDate is the last date as specified by the customer for receiving theshipment.Logic used to consolidate shipments with different RequestedShip DatesTwo shipments with different Requested Ship Dates are consolidated into oneshipment only when the Requested Ship Date falls between the Expected ShipDate and the Must Ship Before Date of the shipment to which the new orderrelease is consolidated.For the shipment consolidation to occur, the Must Ship Before Date should be setin an appropriate way. For instance, if the Requested Cancel Date is less than theMust Ship Before Date, then the Must Ship Before Date should be set to theRequest Cancel Date.held until they fulfil the weight or volume thresholds, or complete the maximumnumber of days specified in the ""Allow shipment delay"" parameter, or theshipments' shipping window.Shipments' shipping window refers to the window within which a shipment has tobe shipped, and is bound by the ""Requested Ship Date"" on the shipment and the""must ship before date"".The ""must ship before date"" is computed as follows:Step 1 Ascertaining customer requested ship dateIf a Customer Requested Ship Date exists for the order, it is used.If a Customer Requested Ship Date is not available for the order, then one of thefollowing methods is used: If the order has a Requested Delivery Date, the Customer Requested Ship Dateis computed by subtracting the Global Transit Time from the Requested DeliveryDate, and based on the ""End of Shift"" parameter using the end of shift of theresulting date.

They are using arange of flexible choices in order to optimize their shipping times and costs.Table 42. Example: Board Game Department Routing GuideCondition ActionShipment weight is lessthan 5 pound and service isNext DayUse FedExShipment weight is lessthan 10 pounds and serviceis 2nd dayUse UPSShipment weight is morethan 10 pounds andshipping from CT, NY orRI to NY or NJShip to NJ distributor using the carrier service NY SpecialFreightShipment weight is morethan 10 pounds andshipping from CT, NY orRI to California, Coloradoor WashingtonShip to shipping address, using the carrier service CrossCountry Carrier or Big and Bulky Carrierand so on......When shipping to the Jolly Toy Company, the enterprise organization consultsthese Routing Guides. Based on the department to which the shipment is going,the appropriate conditions are assessed, and the appropriate actions are used.The use of routing guides is optional. Both buyers and enterprises can establishrouting guides. If both the buyer and enterprise establish routing guides, a settingin Freight Terms is used to determine which routing guide to use first.The routing guide for determining a carrier service is complex; it has a series ofconditions to be met based on the criteria specified, such as the requested carriertype, cost optimization, and the lowest numbered priority assigned to the carrier.Table 43. Example: Determining Carrier ServicesCondition ActionShipping Attributes Ship to Tustin California facility using the carrier serviceUPSN Ground for shipping hazardous items.Service charges For UPSN Ground, the service cost is $200.Priority For UPSN Ground, the priority assigned is 2.Dynamic RoutingDynamic routing uses an external resource to determine how to assign shipments toloads. If dynamic routing is used, then the routing guides are not used.Dynamic routing can be performed several ways. One approach is to integrate aTransportation Management System (TMS) with Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. For more information about integration, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Integration Guide. A Transportation Management Systemprovides detailed planning of routing of loads.A second approach to dynamic routing is to implement a User Exit, which thenconsults an external source for routing planning. For example, the buyer maymaintain its own routing system, which takes into account which loads are beingrouted to which facilities on the day of the proposed load shipment. The buyerthen can determine how to route this load. The User Exit can be used to consultthe buyer, and update the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation routingprocessing.For more information about dynamic routing processing, see “Routing a Shipment”on page 263.Delivery PlansA delivery plan is a complete sequence of movements needed to deliver one or moreorders from one or multiple origins to one or multiple destinations. A deliveryplan is comprised of shipments, loads, origins, stops, and destinations. Creating adelivery plan, or manually routing shipments, is done using the ShipmentManagement Console. A console user determines how a shipment should berouted."
Inbound Compliance and Outbound Constraints,"Both the buyer and the enterprise can have requirements and conditions abouthow items in an order should be shipped.Buyers and Inbound ComplianceThe term Inbound compliance refers to the enterprise conforming to the buyer'sconditions about consolidation and delivery.The buyer can have required conditions which must be met when shipping to thatbuyer. For example, a buyer require orders with different order numbers beshipped in separate shipments. Similarly, a buyer may require orders with differentdepartment numbers be shipped in separate shipments.In the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, conditions for inboundcompliance are established in Participant modeling.You can establish these conditions for inbound compliance:Table 44. Inbound Compliance CategoryCategory DescriptionConsolidation Describes if items can be placed in the same shipment.Criteria include: different PO numbers, different ordernumber, different departments, different ""Mark For"", anddifferent Order Types.Table 44. Inbound Compliance Category (continued)Category DescriptionESP Whether to use Economic Shipping parameters, and theconditions of those parameters.Carrier Preferences A list of preferred carriers. These carrier preferences shouldbe honored, if possible, but a shipment can be made using analternative carrier, if no matching preferred carrier can beused.Routing Guide A guide which describes criteria for how to route deliveries.Packaging Describes conditions about mixing items within the same caseor pallet. For example, do not mix items with different UOMsin the same pallet.Also provides conditions about when to apply ShippingContainer Marking.Value Added Services Value Added Services define additional processing orhandling used to provide inventory that meets the buyer'srequirements. See Chapter 10, “Value-Added Services,” onpage 205 for additional information.Enterprise and Outbound ConstraintsThe term Outbound constraints refers to the own conditions of the enterprise forconsolidation and shipping. For example, in order to reduce shipping costs, aenterprise tries to consolidate items by placing as many items as possible into ashipment, until a certain weight is met. The enterprise can set the EconomicShipping Parameters described in “Using Economic Shipping Parameters” on pageIn Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, conditions for outbound compliancecan be established in the Logistics section of the Distributed Order ManagementConfiguration Console.You can establish outbound constraints for these categories.Table 45. Outbound Constraints CategoriesCategory DescriptionConsolidation Describes if items can be placed in the same shipment.Criteria include: different PO numbers, different ordernumber, different departments, different ""Mark For"", anddifferent Order Types.Routing Guide A guide which describes criteria for how to route deliveries.ESP Whether to use Economic Shipping parameters, and theconditions of those parameters.Resolving Conflicting ConditionsYou can establish both inbound compliance (the buyer's conditions) and outboundconstraints (the conditions of the enterprise). If both are established, there may beconflicting conditions when determining shipment consolidation or routing.For example, both the buyer and the enterprise have established EconomicShipping Parameters. In this case, the buyer is willing to wait longer than theenterprise in order consolidate items into a shipment.Table 46. Buyer and Enterprise Economic Shipping ParametersESP Attribute SettingsBuyer SellerWeight threshold 300 kilos 150 kilosVolume threshold 40 cubic meter 20 cubic meterDays to hold 7 4To resolve this conflict, a simple setting is used determine which order to apply thepreferences. When establishing the Freight Terms in Distributed OrderManagement, you can establish the order, which can be: First Buyer then Enterprise First Enterprise then BuyerFor example, if First Buyer then Enterprise is selected, then the Buyer's settings areused. Shipments are consolidated until one of the following occurs: weight threshold of 300 kilos is met volume threshold of 40 cubic meters is met 7 days have elapsed."
Outbound Shipments,"The process for creating a shipment starts when order lines are released forshipment, which creates an order release, and completes when the shipment isdelivered. This process includes: Creating a shipment Routing a shipment Outbound shipment pipeline Outbound shipment consoleCreating a ShipmentWhen order lines are released for shipment, creating an order release. Thefollowing figure illustrate the logic used. The details of this logic can be changedby customizing the Outbound Shipment Pipeline.Constraints and Creating an Order ReleaseWhen an order release is created, it is created by applying a series of rules toensure that the items in an order release can be shipped together. These rulesinclude: Mandatory do-not-mix constraints - These constraints are part of the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation system. A partial list of items that cannot beshipped together is items with different: Ship Node, Ship To Address, FreightTerms, or Buyer Organization. The complete list is defined in the Sales Orderdocument type. Inbound compliance - Optional buyer based rules, such as do not ship itemstogether which have different: Customer PO #, Order Number, Department, orMark For. Outbound constraints - Optional enterprise based rules, such as do not shipitems together which have different: Customer PO #, Order Number,Department, or Mark For. Routing based constraints - Based on the routing guide, if one is in use.By assessing these constraints, the system creates order releases that can beshipped together. This assessment is validated by the create shipment processing.Consolidating ShipmentsIn Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, orders released from IBM orthird-party ERPs, or both can be consolidated to shipments. Consolidation ofShipments is carried out based on various parameters, including Ship To, Buyer,Seller, Mark For, and Economic Shipping Parameters (ESP).For example, a buyer may frequently place orders that must be split into severalshipments, based on some condition, such as order lines being associated withdifferent departments. The items going to the same department may beconsolidated, if ESP processing is used. Here, the routing process begins after theESP conditions are applied and met.Routing a ShipmentRouting refers to the assignment of the optimal carrier and mode to ship ashipment. A mode refers to parcel, less than truck load (LTL) and truck load (TL).The choices available when routing for a shipment is required, include therequirement to consider node or business entity (enterprise) or customer specificcriteria when determining the carrier. A carrier and mode of shipment is chosenafter using the appropriate guide as per the criteria and also factoring in thedestination and weight of the shipment. For example, Parcel carriers often haveweight limits or do not supply to specific zip codes (postal codes).Sterling Warehouse Management System supports the ability to hold a routingguide at the node, enterprise or customer level. The routing guide also captures theeffective dates for the guide. It is typical in an industry that the routing guides arechanged by a buyer every two or three years.The ability to integrate with an external routing guide or a TransportationManagement System is also available.A shipment in Sterling Warehouse Management System can have a pre-assignedcarrier and service, in which case the routing guide is not used. A shipment canspecify the service requested. For example, Best Parcel, which in turn is used in therouting guide to optimize the carrier and shipment mode chosen.The outbound shipment pipeline defines the requirement for a shipment to berouted. The following figure illustrates the logic used.Figure 45 shows an overview of routing. There are three ways that routing can beperformed: Use Routing Guide - Routing is based on the Buyer or Enterprise routing guides Dynamic - Routing is based on an external resource, such as a TransportManagement System or a customized interaction with the buyer. Manual Routing - Shipment routing is established by the console operator.Using Routing GuidesA routing guide in Sterling Warehouse Management System allows specifyingoptimal carrier and mode of shipment (parcel, LTL or TL) based on criteriaincluding requested service, weight, zip codes (postal codes). In situations wheremultiple routing guides are used, the system can be configured to consider theBuyer's routing guide first to determine a carrier. If the Buyer's routing guide failsto determine a carrier, then the system considers the Enterprise's routing guide. Ifthis fails, then the system considers the Hub's routing guide.The system can also be configured to consider the Seller's routing guide first todetermine a carrier. If this fails, the system considers the Hub's routing guide.However, in this case, the Buyer's routing guide is not considered.If a parcel mode of shipment is chosen, then the shipment is marked as routed.Further processing is not required for this shipment. It is possible to consolidate neworders into a shipment, in which case re-routing is done for the shipment.For LTL shipments, shipments are added to an existing load based on the criteriaor a new load is created. A load is grouping of shipments that is shipped to thesame delivery address. All LTL shipments are automatically converted to TLshipments when the shipment volume exceeds the volume specified for a TL. Eachtime a shipment is added to an existing LTL load, re-routing is done for the newload. The shipment is marked as routed. For shipments that are routed as TL, thereis no further consolidation attempted. The shipment is marked as routed.Zone SkippingTypically, carriers group several geographical regions into zones and provideshipping charges for movement of shipments between these zones. Carriers haveconsolidation and break bulk centers in each zone from where the local shipmentswithin the zone are delivered.When shipping shipments between zones, warehouses may find it profitable toship a shipment as an LTL or TL to a carrier in the destination zone. Theseshipments are later shipped within the zone as parcel shipments. Due to this,warehouses skip several zones that are between the source and destination zones.The Zone Skipping functionality of Sterling Warehouse Management Systemenables a warehouse to reduce transportation costs by consolidating individualshipments into an LTL or TL load, shipping them to a region and taking it to thecarrier's break bulk node for that region. This consolidated load is called a BreakBulk Load. Upon reaching the break bulk node, the break bulk load is dismantledand individual shipments are shipped to their destinations based on their SCACand carrier service.Routing in Zone SkippingDuring zone skipping, shipments are routed as follows: From ship node to the break bulk node From the break bulk node to the destination nodeThe SCAC and carrier service of the shipment is set up according to the routingguide. The system determines if a break bulk load exists from ship node to thebreak bulk node. If a break bulk load is present, the shipment is added to it. If nosuch load is present, the system checks for other shipments that satisfy thefollowing conditions: The routing source is Sterling Warehouse Management System. The routing guide is maintained in Sterling Warehouse Management System. The carrier type of the shipment is parcel. The shipment is not manifested. Freight charges are paid by the shipper.If shipments matching the above criteria are found, the system prepares aconsolidated list of all shipments and determines if this consolidated shipmentsatisfies the minimum weight or volume criteria specified for that break bulk node.The system creates a load and adds these shipments to the load. The origin of thisload is marked as the ship node and the destination as break bulk node. The loadis routed and marked as a break bulk load.Note: Any changes made to a shipment that belongs to the break bulk load ispropagated to the load. If a break bulk load is deleted, the shipments belonging toit are automatically re-routed.A break bulk load is deleted if the following conditions are met: None of the shipments belonging to the load are manifested. The minimum weight and volume criteria are not met.Manifesting for Shipments' Shipping ZonesAs a part of routing, the Sterling Warehouse Management System considers parcelshipments that satisfy the following conditions for zone skipping: The shipment is stamped with a break bulk node. The shipment is not a part of any manifest. The shipment maintains a routing guide in Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem. The routing source is assigned by Sterling Warehouse Management System.On meeting the zone skipping threshold weight and volume, the system creates anLTL or TL load to carry these shipments to the break bulk node. Shipments thatbelong to a break bulk load are automatically manifested from the break bulknode.Note: You must configure a break bulk node as a non-WMS ship node. You mustalso configure a different break bulk node for each ship node to ensure that allshipments belonging to the manifest of a break bulk node arrive at the break bulknode at the same time (as part of break bulk load). The close manifest process isnot dependent on the arrival of loads of other ship nodes.The system automatically manifests all shipments belonging to a break bulk loadin the following ways: Shipment Level Integration—All containers of a shipment are manifested whenthe shipment pack process is complete. Package Level Integration—Each container of a shipment is manifested when itspack process is complete.If the user unpacks a manifested container, the shipments are automaticallyun-manifested. For shipments that have shipment level integration with FedEx, allcontainers of the shipment are un-manifested.The open manifest at the break bulk node is closed when you confirm a load.Shipments that belong to a break bulk load are confirmed when the load isshipped from the origin node.Determining the Second Leg Carrier for Parcel ShipmentsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the capability to routeshipments (that are a part of the break bulk load) from the break bulk node to thefinal destination. To achieve this, the user needs to configure a routing guidelinefrom the break bulk node to the final destination.If the second leg routing fails for parcel shipments, then for: Domestic Shipments—The original SCAC and carrier service code is stamped onthe shipment. International Shipment—The ""Could not determine SCAC for second leg""routing error code is stamped on the shipment. Despite this, the shipment goesto the ""Shipment Routed"" status. You must manually resolve the error.Outbound Shipment PipelineThe actual processing of a outbound shipment flows through a set of transactionsand statuses until its completion. This chain of transactions and shipment statusesis called the outbound shipment pipeline.The outbound shipment pipeline provides Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation with a means to perform actions, such as sending notifications orlogging alerts, dependent on the location of the outbound shipment in its pipeline.It also provides you with a means to track an outbound shipment from creation todelivery.The outbound shipment pipeline from which your business runs is unique to howyour system administrator has set up your business environment. However, everyoutbound shipment pipeline generally begins with a transaction that creates anoutbound shipment and ends with a transaction that indicates an order has beendelivered.A transaction is an occurrence that needs to be tracked and can call certain actionsto be performed. A shipment status describes what state an outbound shipment isin and moves it from transaction to transaction.Outbound Shipment Pipeline StatusesThe statuses that an outbound shipment can flow through in the default outboundshipment pipeline of Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation are: Shipment Created - The shipment has been created from an order release or achained order. Shipment Being Picked - The line items are physically being picked inpreparation for shipment. Shipment Shipped - The shipment has been shipped to the ship to address. Shipment Delivered - The shipment has been delivered to the ship node address. Included In Receipt - The shipment has been included in the receipt. Receipt Closed - The shipment has been received and is considered complete. Shipment Invoiced - An invoice has been created for the shipment. ESP Check Required - The ESP evaluator must be run to determine if ESPconditions have been met. On ESP Hold - The shipment is being held until ESP conditions are met. Released From ESP Hold - The ESP conditions have been met, and the ESP Holdis lifted. Shipment Routed - The shipment has been assigned to a load. Sent To Node - The shipment has been sent to be packed. Shipment Cancelled - The shipment has been cancelledThe following figure is a graphical representation of the default outboundshipment pipeline as it appears in the Applications Manager.Outbound Shipment ConsoleThe Outbound Shipment Console provides information on outbound shipmentsmade from sales orders and shipment containers. It provides Sellers, node users,and Carriers with information necessary to ensure on-time shipment of the correctorders.An order becomes an outbound shipment when an order release is packed and it isphysically ready to be shipped by the shipping node. A shipment details the shipto address, dimensions, shipment charges, carrier information, and informationabout the lines shipped.A outbound shipment as an entity can be used in a delivery plan by attaching it toa load. For more information about setting up delivery plans and loads, see theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Logistics Management User Guide.Creating a Bundle ShipmentWhen order information for a bundle is available, the creation of a shipment for abundle occurs based on whether a bundle parent is added to a shipment or thecomponents of a bundle are added to a shipment.When a bundle parent is added to a shipment the components of the bundle arenot automatically added to the shipment.When a bundle component is added to a shipment or a shipment is created for acomponent, its parent line and all n-level lines are also added to the shipment ifthey have not been added previously.When order information for a bundle is not available, the components of thebundle are taken from the catalog.Confirming a Bundle ShipmentWhen shipping the last component in a bundle, the status of a parent line changesto shipped or its extended status, based on the pipeline setup.When the ratio of a bundle component is not maintained, the order line status isonly updated when the entire bundle ships.For a bundle parent, confirm shipment quantity is stamped as the max of thecomponent quantity at Shipment level. However, on the OrderLine the exact parentquantity shipped is shown.Invoicing a Bundle ShipmentThe Enterprise level rule ""When to invoice Bundle Parent Line"" determines how abundle is invoiced. This rule has two values: First and Last. When the rule is set toFirst, a bundle is invoiced whenever one of its components are shipped. When therule is set to Last, a bundle is invoiced only when all of its components areshipped.“Customer Orders Two Bed Set Bundles” explains how a bundle is invoiced basedon this Enterprise level rule.Customer Orders Two Bed Set BundlesIn this example, a customer has ordered two Bed Sets. A Bed Set is a bundle thatconsists of the following: Bed Set (Parent Bundle)– Mattress– Bed Frame"
Loads,"A load carries one or more complete shipments (never a partial shipment) betweentwo points. Loads are created as a result of the routing for a shipment. See“Routing a Shipment” on page 263 for more details.Creating a LoadCreating a load is done as a part of the routing process. During routing processing,shipments can either be added to existing loads, or a new load is created. A newload may be created either because no load is currently being shipped to thelocation where the shipment is going, or because current loads cannotaccommodate the shipment.For more information, see “Routing a Shipment” on page 263.Load Execution PipelineBeginning from its creation, a load document flows through a set of transactionsand statuses until its completion. This chain of transactions and shipment statusesis called the load execution pipeline.The load execution pipeline provides Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationwith a means to perform actions, such as sending notifications or logging alerts,dependent on the location of the load in its pipeline. It also provides you with ameans to track a load from creation to delivery.The load execution pipeline from which your business runs is unique to how yoursystem administrator has set up your business environment. However, every loadexecution pipeline generally begins with a transaction that creates a load and endswith a transaction that indicates a load has reached its assigned destination stop.A transaction is an occurrence that needs to be tracked and can call certain actionsto be performed. A load status describes what state a load is in and moves it fromtransaction to transaction.The statuses that a load can flow through in the default load execution pipeline ofSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation are: Load Created Trailer Loaded Load In Transit Load ClosedThe following figure is a graphical representation of the default load executionpipeline as it appears in the Applications Manager."
Inbound Shipments,"An order becomes an inbound shipment when a purchase order release is packedand it is physically ready to be shipped by the shipping node.Inbound Shipment PipelineBeginning from its creation, an inbound shipment flows through a set oftransactions and statuses until its completion. This chain of transactions andinbound shipment statuses is called the inbound shipment pipeline.The inbound shipment pipeline provides Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation with a means to perform actions, such as sending notifications orlogging alerts, dependent on the location of the inbound shipment in its pipeline. Italso provides you with a means to track an inbound shipment from creation todelivery.The inbound shipment pipeline from which your business runs is unique to howyour system administrator has set up your business environment. However, everyinbound shipment pipeline generally begins with a transaction that creates aninbound shipment and ends with a transaction that indicates an order has beendelivered.A transaction is an occurrence that needs to be tracked and can call certain actionsto be performed.

Shipment Being Picked - The line items are physically being picked inpreparation for shipment. Shipment Shipped - The shipment has been shipped to the ship to address. Shipment Delivered - The shipment has been delivered to the ship node address. Included In Receipt - The shipment has been included in the receipt. Shipment Invoiced - An invoice has been created for the shipment.Inbound Shipment ConsoleThe Inbound Shipment Console provides information on inbound shipments madefrom purchase orders and inbound shipment containers. It provides Sellers, nodeusers, and Carriers with information necessary to ensure on-time inboundshipment of the correct orders.An order becomes an inbound shipment when a purchase order release is packedand it is physically ready to be shipped by the shipping node. An inboundshipment details the ship to address, dimensions, inbound shipment charges,carrier information, and information about the lines shipped.An inbound shipment as an entity can be used in a delivery plan by attaching it toa load. For more information about configuring delivery plans and loads, see theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Logistics Management Configuration Guide."
Hold Processing,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows a shipment or load to be heldfor multiple reasons. Holds of a certain type prevent a shipment or load frombeing processed by transactions that are associated with that hold type. Holds ofcertain types can also prevent certain modifications to be applied to a shipment orload. If an enterprise wants to perform an address verification every time anaddress is changed or a date verification every time a delivery date is changed, theshipment or load needs to be kept from being processed until those checks arecompleted.A hold can be in three different statuses: Created, when the hold has just been applied to a shipment or load, and has notyet been examined. Rejected, when the hold has been reviewed by a supervisor who decided thatthe shipment or load should not be processed. Resolved, when the hold has been reviewed by a supervisor who decided thatthe shipment or load should be processed.Hold types can be applied in the following ways: Manually: a supervisor may feel that a shipment or load needs to be placed onhold for fraud check, and applies the hold through the Application Console. It ispossible to configure a particular hold type so that only users of a specificgroup, or set of groups, can apply the hold to a shipment or load. Automatically on shipment or load creation: every time a shipment or load iscreated, it is placed on a specific hold type by default. Automatically upon resolution of another hold type: if a certain hold type isresolved, it can trigger another hold type automatically. This is specified in thehold type that is being applied on resolution of the other. Automatically when a specific modification type occurs: hold types can beconfigured to be placed automatically when a certain modification type occurs atthe shipment or load level, for instance a terrorist threat hold when there is atip-off that a load may contain bombs or drugs for a terrorist organization.Independent of how the hold is applied, it is possible to specify a condition thatdetermines whether or not the shipment or load should be put on hold. Forexample, you could want to place only shipments with a specific delivery addresson hold. You can use the condition builder to do this on a hold type. For moreinformation about using the condition builder, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.By default, all transactions are allowed to process a shipment or load that is onhold. Using the Applications Manager, you can specify which transactions areprevented from processing a shipment or load that is in a particular hold type.Transactions that can be configured to not process shipments or loads on hold areknown as hold type enabled transactions, and are defined at the document typelevel for a given enterprise. Custom transactions that are not derived from anabstract transaction are all hold type enabled.Two transactions need to be configured to process shipments or loads that are in ahold type, and then remove them from that hold: one for holds in created status,and another for holds in rejected status. Additionally, holds can be resolvedmanually, and it is possible to specify a set of user groups with the authorizationto do so. That, too, is done at the document type level for a given enterprise, in theApplications Manager."
What Is Reverse Logistics?,"Reverse Logistics involves managing the return process for your products. Userscan view return order information to inspect returned items, determine howreturned items should be handled, and provide the Buyer with the necessaryamount of credit for the return."
Parts of a Return Order,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, a return order can be broken downinto three levels, the return order header level, return order line level, and returnorder release level. The return order header level contains all of the return orderlines that have been returned, the return order line level is broken down by eachindividual line that has been returned, and the return order release level containsall of the lines that have been released to a return node."
Reverse Logistics Pipeline,"Beginning from its creation, a return order flows through a set of transactions andstatuses until its completion. This chain of transactions and return order statuses iscalled the reverse logistics pipeline. There are two default pipelines, the standardReverse Logistics pipeline and the Consumer Returns pipeline used to handlecustomer returns to the retail site.A reverse logistics pipeline provides Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationwith a means to perform actions, such as sending notifications or logging alerts,dependent on the location of the return order in the pipeline. It also provides youwith a means to track a return order from creation to completion and perform anymanual interventions, if necessary.The reverse logistics pipeline from which your business runs is unique to howyour system administrator has set up your business environment. However, everyreverse logistics pipeline generally begins with a transaction that creates a returnorder and ends with a transaction that indicates a return order has been closed.A transaction is an occurrence that needs to be tracked and can call certain actionsto be performed. A return order status describes what state a return order is in andmoves it from transaction to transaction.Reverse Logistics Pipeline StatusesThe following statuses may be used in a Reverse Logistics pipeline, depending onhow it is configured within your system: Authorized - The return has been authorized by the applicable parties as peryour business practices.

Business Challenges,"Increasing customer demands and an ever-changing environment drives businessestoday. Some factors that influence business processes are: mergers and acquisitionsv introduction of new products or product lines servicing new customers addition of new business channels consolidation of facilities business outsourcingAs businesses strive to keep pace with the changing environment, it is alsoimperative to keep operating costs low.Businesses must manage inventory in a variety of facilities that may include PlantWarehouses, Regional IBM Sterling Business Centers, Stock Rooms, Stores, andFlow-through Distribution Centers.Due to the disparate nature of these facilities, each facility employs differentoperational processes. This leads to complexity in operations and lack ofcentralized visibility, increased infrastructure costs, and quality issues.Due to the variety of facilities in a complex warehousing environment, disparatesystems are used throughout the network. This results in higher infrastructure andownership cost at each facility. Integrating systems across disparate facilitiesbecomes complex, and implementing business process changes is a challenge.

This is when the user has toswitch between nodes to access multiple nodes. Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem enables a user to access multiple nodes and perform various warehouseoperations. After the user switches to a different node, all the transactional datathat is displayed and recorded will be in the context of the node the user iscurrently working on.Permission to access multiple nodes is based on the teams assigned to the users inthe Applications Manager. Depending on the access permission granted to theteam the user is assigned to, the user can access a set of nodes."
Inventory Control and Tracking,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides comprehensive functionalityto track, monitor, and maintain inventory in a warehouse. Inventory visibility isprovided through consoles that provide granular information, as necessary.The features provided by the Sterling Warehouse Management System forInventory Control are: Real time and accurate inventory information Inventory tracking at a granular level Comprehensive inventory audit trail Comprehensive control of movements within the warehouse to synchronize themovement of products and real time information Complete management of transfer between warehouses Industry standard count proceduresThe Sterling Warehouse Management System enables inventory tracking based onitem attributes at a warehouse and location level. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System provides various inventory tracking attributes, such as: Enterprise in a warehouse Product Class Inventory Status Unit of Measure Container First In First Out Receipt Country Of Origin Tag Number Serial Number Segment Expiration Date Industry examples include:A manufacturer sets up a separate business channel for ""Direct to Consumer"".Same warehouse can be used to manage fulfillment for ""Direct to Consumer"" or""To Retail"" channel.A 3PL logistics provider can service multiple clients from the same facility,which enables utilization of all resources in a warehouse across multipleenterprises.The Sterling Warehouse Management System has the ability to track inventory foran enterprise down to a location level. This eliminates the need to have a zoneconfigured for an enterprise. Similarly, an organization may have multiple businesschannels in the same warehouse.The resulting advantages are better asset utilization, resource utilization andcomplete support for multi-tenancy.Also, transfer of inventory between business channels in a warehouse does notrequire any physical movement of product.Product ClassIn a traditional warehouse environment, inventory of finished goods is representedas a good quality product. Inventory that fails quality control requiresrepresentation as bad inventory. For example, shoes with a different shade thanwhat is specified. In best practice situations, these must be maintained andtransacted with the understanding that it is bad inventory.The Sterling Warehouse Management System maintains bad inventory under adifferent product class. This maintains item integrity and simplifies handling froma global inventory perspective. This also provides immediate visibility of SKUs attheir product class level. An example of product class attribute is described in thefollowing table.Industry examples include:Finished goods marked as First QualityFinished goods marked as Factory DefectsFinished goods marked as IrregularsThe advantages provided include a single item ID across multiple product classes.Inventory StatusThe Sterling Warehouse Management System is capable of tracking the inventorystatus of an item. The inventory status of an item influences the inventory as beingallocatable or non-allocatable.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows specification of inventorystatus at a zone level.For example, consider a warehouse that prefers only products to storage as eligiblefor order reservation. After receipt, the product is expected to be in ’AwaitingPutaway’ status, and after move into storage the product is expected to be in’Good Inventory’ status.In the Sterling Warehouse Management System, the receiving dock location or zonewould be configured as ’Awaiting Putaway’ inventory status and the storagezone(s) would be configured as ""Good Inventory"" inventory status. At theinventory status level, you would indicate that ’Awaiting Putaway’ isnon-allocatable and ’Good Inventory’ as allocatable. An example of inventorystatus attribute is described in the following table.Industry examples include: Good inventory Awaiting putaway Held under quality control Awaiting inspection Pending rework ScrappedUnit of MeasureThe Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks inventory at the UOM level. AUOM translates to the type of packaging of an SKU.An SKU has its own basic UOM called as Inventory UOM in the SterlingWarehouse Management System. For example, the basic UOM for a shoe is EACH.Similarly that of metal sheets is a ROLL, a metal block is in cubic metres, milk inounces or gallons or liters dependent on the region in the world. These UOMs areunique at a SKU level and define the lowest such measure that an item has. Thefolowing figure depicts UOM for various items.Let us expand this concept a further. If you have an item, say milk, then a carton iseither a half-gallon or a gallon or 2 gallons. Each of these is sold in supermarketsas individual measures. The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports thisby having multiple Inventory UOMs for a single item. Another well-knownexample is a battery pack, sold as 4-pack, 6-pack, 12-pack. Needless to say, thebeverage industry has made a 6-pack and a case (12-pack) very popular.From the above discussion, it is apparent that each item has its own uniqueInventory UOM, as well as, additional Inventory UOMs. The following figuredepicts UOM for a 6-Pack and 16-Pack batteries.Now let us consider inventory being received, procured and ordered. Typically,inventory is also received in multiples of inventory UOMs, for example, case of4-pack batteries or a pallet of milk cartons. These measures further definealternative methods of addressing an Inventory UOM. They have a directrelationship to the inventory UOM. In the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem, these UOMs are called as alternate UOMs. Alternate UOMs are case packof 20 6-pack batteries, half-pallet of 1 gallon cartons of milk, pallet ofair-conditioners. The following figure depicts case pack UOM.The Sterling Warehouse Management System therefore allows you to transact(receive, purchase, sell, move) inventory at UOM levels that are appropriate for thetransaction, further removing the constraint of the way the inventory is stored.The advantages of tracking inventory and alternate UOMs in inventory are: Ideally, in applications that cannot track multiple Inventory UOMs for the sameitem, a unique SKU is defined for each UOM. If you define separate SKU foreach inventory UOM, warehouse would lose visibility for the product. Hence,tracking inventory with the same SKU and different inventory UOM providecorrect visibility to the inventory on WMS and it represents the physicalinventory. Ability to place and source orders at a higher UOM level and have the WMStranslate those quantities to appropriate lower Inventory UOMs.ContainerThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides visibility to inventory at acontainer level. A container in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is acase or a pallet that is tracked by a License Plate Number (LPN) and may containother cases or inner packs.Single or Multiple SKU Case with LPNThe Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks a case license plate formultiple quantities of a single stock-keeping unit (SKU). Inventory tracking ismaintained at the case with LPN level based on location attributes. This trackingcould be disabled in the loose or active pick areas where individual items handled.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also supports the breaking of a caseat any location for partial retrieval or pick. The following table provides anexample of single or multiple SKU case with LPN attribute.Industry examples include: Case of 12 boots with an LPN Musical runs for footwear in casesThe advantages include tracking of unique UOM quantities by a case with LPN.Single SKU case with inner packsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System is also capable of identifying thenumber of inner packs available in a case. An example of single SKU case attributeis described in the following table.An example of single SKU case with inner pack quantity is described in the 'SingleSKU Case with Inner Pack Quantity' table.Industry examples include: Pens come in packs of 20, which in turn is placed in a larger cartonThe advantages include ability to define and understand inner pack quantities.Single or Multiple SKU Pallet with LPNIn addition to supporting a single item at case and pallet levels, the SterlingWarehouse Management System also supports multiple SKUs on a case and palletwith LPN as shown in the following figure. Inventory visibility is provided at theindividual SKU in their respective quantities.Industry examples include: Pallet of calculators with an LPN Outbound or shipment pallets with LPNThe advantages include the ability to receive, putaway, retrieve and allocateproduct individually on a pallet with LPN.Multi-level LPNThe Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks a case level license plateattached to a pallet for multiple SKUs as shown in the following figure.Industry examples include:Complete outbound shipment with ASN complianceThe advantage include complete inventory tracking and ability to move inventoryat both the pallet and case with LPN levels.Case and Pallet with Unknown ContentsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks inventory for a case or palletwith unknown contents by using an LPN as shown in the following figure.Industry examples include: Pre-receipt during returns Customers who do not require granular level details for outbound shipments Distro operations Flow through warehouses (parcel companies) Public warehousingThe advantages include:A case or pallet with LPN once assigned is re-usable across all processes anduniquely identifies the SKU(s) and quantity associatedUsage of case or pallet with LPN allows warehouses to store and track inventorythat has multiple COO, receipt number, serial number at a locationA case or pallet with LPN may be reserved partially or completely for amovement or orderA case or pallet with LPN simplifies the movement to that of scanning of a barcode. For example, a pallet with LPN containing 20 cases, when moved fromone location to another, requires only the LPN to be scanned.First In First OutA warehouse that calculates turnover of inventory requires ensuring that inventoryis tracked using the First In First Out (FIFO) methodology. The requirement couldbe limited to a few items as well. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemgenerates a unique FIFO number upon receipt of such items. The SterlingWarehouse Management System ensures that the oldest inventory is first allocatedto orders.All receipts received within a specified date period are assigned the same FIFOnumber. An example of FIFO attribute is described in the following table. Theexample considers the FIFO period as a month.Industry examples include: Leather based products like wallets that loose color after a period of time Electronics like PDA and cameras have newer versions very oftenThe advantages include: Reduced obsolescence Ability to distinguish aged product Ability to identify velocity or inventory turnaroundReceiptThe Sterling Warehouse Management System identifies each receipt with a uniquereceipt number. This number is used to track inventory back to the shipmentnumber. An example of receipt number attribute is described in the followingtables.Industry examples include: Recall of specific shipments Post receipt quality inspectionsThe advantages include: Ability to track inventory by their shipment and/or receipt numbers in storage Ability to retrieve from a specific receipt for inspection Modify inventory status at a receipt levelThe Sterling Warehouse Management System supports multiple receipt numbers ata location only when an inventory is maintained at a case or pallet with LPN level.Country Of OriginThe Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks the COO of an item beingreceived. COO is determined based on shipment details or purchase order detailsduring receipt or manually entered in inventory adjustments. The values capturedmay be used for customer compliance. An example of COO attribute is describedin the following table.The advantages include: Segregate inventory by COO. Reduce manual determination of COO information for preparing internationalshipping documents such as Commercial Invoice.The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports multiple COOs at a locationonly if inventory is maintained at a case or pallet with LPN level.Tag NumberThe Sterling Warehouse Management System allows tracking of inventory back tothe exact batch it was manufactured through the usage of a tag number.Lot NumberLot number is a unique number allocated to one or more product duringmanufacture or assembly to enable traceability.Industry examples include: Set of picture tubes received in a warehouse Pallet of keyboards on holdCut Lot NumberIn addition to tracking the lot number, further granularity is achieved to a cut lotlevel.Industry example include: Wood industry.Dye Lot NumberIn the clothing industry, most yarns require a dye lot number to ensure that all thepieces are the same color.Industry examples include: Wallpaper Knitting woolCoffee Grind LevelTo ensure the best flavor in a cup of coffee, coffee needs to be ground well so thatthe proper amount of soluble material is extracted from the bean.Industry examples include: Expresso machines require extra fine grind Coffee press requires coarse grindWood GradingIn the timber industry, wood is treated with chemicals that provide color, texture,strength, resistance.Industry examples include: Air dried Kiln dried Chemically treatedRevision NumberItems that frequently undergo an engineering change are assigned with differentrevision numbers. The Sterling Warehouse Management System has the ability torecord the revision numbers of such item.Industry examples include: Spare parts industry ElectronicsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System allows the definition of a set ofadditional identifiers for specific items that needs to be tracked in inventory usingthe Tag attribute. This enables a warehouse to decide what attributes of an itemneeds to be tracked in inventory and allows a warehouse to track inventory at agranular level. An example of user defined attributes applied to an item isdescribed in the following table.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows a warehouse to trackadditional attributes against these identifiers. For example, a warehouse may trackinventory by lot number for certain items. Additional attributes such asmanufacturing date, manufacturing plant number can also be tracked against thelot number.The advantages include: Visibility to location level inventory at most granular level. Ability to hold inventory based on additional inventory attributes. For example,warehouse may receive request from the manufacturing plant to put a specificlot number on hold. Ability to ship inventory of specific inventory attributes. For example,warehouse may receive order to ship an item of specific revision or lot number. Ability to specify on an order the requirement of a specific tag. The SterlingWarehouse Management System allocates all tag numbers to an order that doesnot have a specific tag.Serial NumberSerial number is recorded at the point of receipt, inventory adjustments or duringoutbound shipments. SKUs that require serial number tracking are uniquelyidentified in the Sterling Warehouse Management System. Serial number trackingin the Sterling Warehouse Management System is provided at the global supplychain network level. The Sterling Warehouse Management System is capable oftracking serial numbers in inventory at a SKU and its components level as shownin the following figure.Industry examples include: Mobile phones Telephones Automobile parts Demagnetized computer tool kit, which includes: Nine allen wrenches Six piece mini screw driver set Five SAE sockets, five metric socketsThe advantage include: Track at a serial number level for returns and recalls Ability to put specific serial number on hold Ability to ship specific serial numbersSegmentA warehouse often performs specific value-added services before shippinginventory to specific customers.Some examples of value-added services are:applying customer price ticketsapplying security tagsprinting company logo and name on the productPerforming value-added service is labor-intensive. If value-added services areperformed subsequent to receiving sales order, then it may result in increased cycletime for fulfilling the order. In order to reduce order fulfillment cycle time,warehouse often perform customer specific value-added services for specificproducts ahead of receiving the actual outbound order.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the ability to designateinventory that is reserved for a customer through the use of segments. An exampleof MTC segment attribute is described in the following table.In this example, 100 units of inventory in location 13C01 contains inventory that has Cust-Name special tickets. This inventory is allocated only to orders shipped toCust-Name. Whereas, inventory in location 13C02 does not have any value-addedservices, and therefore can be allocated to other customers who do not require anyvalue-added services.A segment may also be used for in the ""Made to Order"" situation. Some examplesof ""Made to Order"" situation are: Customer placing an order for a Desktop PC with certain configurations. Ordering shoes with certain parameters or specifications.Warehouse may receive such ""Made to Order"" inventory through service providersbuilt outside, or use VAS module to build order specific inventory. Inventory builtfor specific order may not be picked, packed and shipped on the same day.Therefore, a warehouse may need to stock such inventory subsequent tomanufacturing or receiving inventory. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemis capable of associating location-level inventory to a specific order to ensure that inventory is allocated only to that order. An example of MTO segment attribute isdescribed in the following table, which explains that location 13C01 is built for aspecific order and is not allocated to any other orders.Expiration DateThe Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks the inventory of itemsdesignated as time sensitive items by expiration date, and ensures that expireditems are not allocated to any order. An example of expiration date attribute isdescribed in the following table.Industry examples include: Canned foods Processed foods (Milk, Meat) Pharmaceutical"
Inventory Visibility in the Application Console,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables inventory visibility in theApplication Consoles at a very granular level. The level of visibility is based on thelevel at which inventory is tracked in a warehouse.Visibility to inventory levels and respective attributes are provided through aconsole. The combinations of attributes are better illustrated through use cases orexamples, which include:View inventory across all SKUs at the warehouse level for an enterpriseThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship Node.View defective inventory for a SKU for an enterprise at a warehouse that are ina specific type of LPNThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship node, Item ID, Pallet ID, Case ID. Inaddition to this, if you want to view all items that are on Quality Hold, then useInventory status as criteria.View all inventory built for a specific order, order typeThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship Node, Segment, and Segment TypeView all inventory available in a specific zoneThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship node, and Zone.View all inventory for inbound shipment number or PO numberCriteria used include Enterprise, Ship Node and receipt number correspondingto shipment or purchase order number.View all location level inventories that have been frozen for pickThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship node, check flag for frozen locationsonly.View all location level inventories that have been frozen due to count varianceThe criteria used include Ship node and check flag for frozen locations only.View all inventory that has aged, say 30 days and older, in a warehouseThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship node, Inventory age 'greater than orequal to' 30 days.View all inventory for a serial number rangeThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship Node, Item ID, Serial number 'startswith' option.View all inventory for wood that has been kiln dried and has at least 10 piecesin a lotThe criteria used include Enterprise, Ship node, Tag Attribute - Kiln Dried'equals' Y and Tag Attribute - Number of pieces 'greater than' 10.In addition to inventory level attributes, the warehouse manager manages andviews location level attributes to list the following:Locations that are empty and available across all zones or limited to certainzones.Locations that are frozen for picking or putaway.Locations that are empty and of high velocity.Locations those are empty in a specific area for frozen items or hazardous items.Locations that are sharing a staging location.In addition to the features provided at the console or screen level, the viewing ofdata is limited to that of users permissions. In a multi-client or multi-enterprisescenario, a user assigned to a specific client can view only that client's inventory.This also holds true for out sourced providers having only access to inventory thatthey own (Vendor Managed Inventory [VMI]).Inventory AuditThe Sterling Warehouse Management System audits all inventory transactions thatoccur in a warehouse. Audits are written in the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem for each transaction along with appropriate reference values and SKUattributes for tracking purposes. The combination of attributes are better illustratedthrough the following use cases or examples:View all transactions for a SKU for the last 2 daysCriteria used include ship node, SKU, date and timeView all transactions for a shipment or orderCriteria used include ship node, shipmentView all positive inventory adjustment done due to count errorsCriteria used include ship node, and task typeView all transactions performed by a user todayCriteria used include ship node, user, date and timeView all transactions for a tag number or serial numberCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, tag number, serial numberView all transactions for an LPNCriteria used include ship node, case or pallet with LPNCleaning out Accounting BinIBM Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the ability to clean orzero out accounting bin locations. Accounting bin locations are usually cleaned outby warehouses at the end of a physical or cycle count process in order to publishand reconcile inventory discrepancies between the systems."
Inventory Visibility in the Mobile Application,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides inventory visibility usingRadio Frequency (RF) devices through the Mobile Application. Using the mobileapplication, you can inquire into:Inventory that exists in a location.Items packaged into an inventory container.Locating the specific serial number of a serialized item.Inventory availability for an item.Shipment information for an outbound container.The attributes are better illustrated through use cases or examples, which include:View the entire inventory available in a location.The criteria used is Location ID.View the contents of an inventory container (Pallet LPN or Case LPN).The criteria used is Container Number.Determine the location of a misplaced container or serialized item.The criteria used is Container Number or Serial Number.View the inventory availability for an item in the warehouse.The criteria used is Item ID.View the shipment information for an outbound container.The criteria used is Container SCM.Inventory ModificationsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System allows modification of inventorythrough the Application Consoles. Inventory modifications in a warehouse areeither initiated manually, or as part of cycle count or physical count process.Examples of inventory modifications are:Adjusting the onhand quantity of a SKU at a location or license plate (existingor non-existing LPN)Changing the inventory attribute without changing on hand quantity:Tag numberExpiration date, FIFO dateCOOProduct ClassInventory Status"
Sorting Before Putaway,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the ability to sort inventoryin a warehouse based on location, zone, or set of zones where inventory needs tobe put away. The user can then build pallets or cases for the sorted inventorybased on the target location."
Putaway,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System categorizes putaway request as amove from a particular location without necessarily specifying the target location.In situations, where the target location is not specified, the Sterling WarehouseManagement System utilizes its putaway algorithms to determine the optimaltarget location(s).A putaway request is either created automatically due to a related event that iscarried out, or manually initiated by a user.Some examples for automated requests include:Putaway from Dock—the receiving department requests the inventorydepartment to putaway stock at the dock location, specifying only the receiptand dock-location. For example, the receipt of an item or closure of a receipt fora shipment initiates a putaway request.Putaway from Value-Added Services—the VAS department requests theinventory department to move stock out of a VAS location. For example, a workorder completion creates inventory that requires move to storage locations.An example for manual move requests include:Putaway after Quality Inspection—the inspection department requests theinventory department to move inventory that has completed inspection afterreceipt to the storage locations.Putaway requests are placed in the Sterling Warehouse Management System taskmanagement, which utilizes constraints and preferences configured at thewarehouse level to determine the optimal target location(s).Putaway AlgorithmThe Sterling Warehouse Management System putaway algorithm utilizes criteriathat include SKU, packaging type, capacity constraints and sorting/sequencingstrategy. The algorithm goes through all locations in a warehouse and applies orverifies constraints to arrive at the optimal location. The following figure illustratesthe putaway algorithm.The putaway algorithm is initiated based on events that occur in a warehouse.The business process configuration and algorithm answers the following questions:When to putaway?Putaway inventory upon receipt or after inspection or VAS is complete. Anotherexample is, initiation of a putaway request after completing VAS.What to putaway?Putaway can be initiated for a SKU, case or pallet with LPN. It can also beinitiated for Pallets or Cases that do not have contents. Each of these attributesinfluence the resultant locations.Where and how to putaway?Constraints for storage, capacity and storage preferences are considered.Storage ConstraintsStorage constraints are specified in a warehouse to match an item or inventoryattributes to a location. The Sterling Warehouse Management System ensures thatconstraints defined are not violated while suggesting putaway locations. Differentconstraints defined are:Zone DedicationA zone in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is a group of locations thathave similar attributes. A zone in a warehouse is used to distinguish storage typesor types of item stored.Ability to designate a zone to an enterprise.An example is a 3PL warehouse that has multiple clients. When a zone isdedicated to a specific or set of enterprises, only products belonging to thoseenterprises is putaway into the zone.Ability to restrict a zone for a particular type of SKU or storage typesAn example is a zone for hazardous or high-value items. When a zone isdedicated to a specific type of item, other types of products cannot be putawayinto such zones.Location level DedicationsA specific location can be dedicated to an item. This automatically restricts otheritems into the same location.Zone level product mixing or segregation constraintsA warehouse can define additional constraints for each zone so that products withdifferent inventory attributes are not putaway in the same location. Theseattributes include enterprise, SKU, and receipt number. An example of storagetypes and constraints are described in the following table.A warehouse that tracks inventory at a case or pallet with LPN could combineenterprises in the same location. This would result in better asset and resourceutilization.Capacity ConstraintsA warehouse can define capacity constraint in terms of maximum weight and/orvolume that can be putaway to a location. In addition to weight or volume, theSterling Warehouse Management System allows defining capacity constraints interms of number of units of a specific UOM. For example, a location may hold fourpallets for all items except for some items that are large and can hold only onepallet.Storage PreferencesIn addition to defining constraints at zone or location level, the Sterling WarehouseManagement System sets additional preferences specific to inventory type. Anexample of storage preferences is described in the following table.A warehouse configuration in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is illustrated in the following figure.Putaway ExecutionThe Sterling Warehouse Management System generates appropriate tasks for eachputaway request. The Sterling Warehouse Management System Task Managementis used to complete these tasks using printed move tickets, RF Mobile Terminal, orby integrating with Material Handling Equipment (MHE).Execution of these tasks uses strategies that include:One request at a time—a user completes the request in one trip or multiple trips.Multiple requests at a time—a user completes tasks across requests in a singletrip for more efficiency purposes. (This is very similar to a batch pick scenario.)A putaway request may result in multiple steps being carried out. For example,usage of a drop-off location during inbound creates a two-step putaway task.(Dock to drop-off and drop-off to storage.)The Sterling Warehouse Management System can be used to control putawaytask suggestion by placing constraints based on a user or attributes, such asshipment number or work order number. For more information, see TaskManagement.Putaway VisibilityThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides complete visibility to thestatus of putaway requests. The visibility is at a granular level indicating therequest and attributes used to initiate the request.The visibility to putaway requests is provided through console. Users view moverequests by status or item, and source and target locations. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System also provides audit trail views. The combination of attributesare illustrated through the following use cases or examples:View putaway requests that have exceptions for a receipt numberThe criteria used include department, receipt numberView open putaway or retrieval requests for a source or target locationThe criteria used include department, status, and source or target locationView audit trail for putaway requests of an inbound shipmentThe criteria used include department and shipment number. The details page atthe request level displays the complete audit trailThe Sterling Warehouse Management System also allows the cancellation of anentire move request or the removal of a part of a move request."
Retrieval,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System categorizes a retrieval request as amove request to a particular location without necessarily specifying the source. Insituations where the source location is not specified, the Sterling WarehouseManagement System utilizes its retrieval algorithms to determine the optimalsource locations.A request can be specified at an item level with no attributes, even thoughinventory is tracked at a more granular level.Some examples for automated requests include:Retrieval for Value-Added Services:The VAS department requests the inventorydepartment to move stock to a VAS-station. For example, a work order initiatesa retrieval request for move of inventory to VAS department.Retrieval for Replenishment:The picking department requests retrieval of itemsneeded for a picking wave to their respective locations specifying the locationand item to be retrieved. For example, a wave released initiates a retrievalrequest for inventory from bulk locations to pick locations.Retrieval for Shipment;The release of a shipment without using wave planningcreates retrieval tasks that are directed to the appropriate packing zones. Forexample, customer pick-up scenario or for urgent orders.Some examples for manual move requests include:Retrieval for Quality Inspection:The inspection department requests theinventory department to retrieve stock for a specific receipt and inventory statusfor inspection. For example, a defective inventory found results in a retrievalrequest for either remaining inventory in the location or for the receipt numberof the inventory.Retrieval for Manufacturing:The manufacturing department requests for rawmaterial depending on the consumption of raw material on the manufacturinglines.Retrieval for Manual Move Request and Execution:Ad hoc request to moveadditional inventory from one location to another. This is mainly to allocatespace for new receipts received in a warehouse. For example, relocation of thelast remaining pallet from a multi-deep pallet location to a single pallet deeplocation.Retrieval AlgorithmThe Sterling Warehouse Management System retrieval algorithm utilizes criteriathat include SKU classification, UOM and zones, and sequencing strategies. Thealgorithm retrieves products from eligible locations in a warehouse and employseither the 'pick to clean' or 'least pick' methods. The following figure illustrates theretrieval algorithm.The business process configuration and algorithm answers the following questions:What location do I retrieve to?Retrieve to location corresponding to department that places requestautomatically or manually through move request. For example, VAS requestingfor component inventory.What locations do I retrieve from?Retrieval strategy values to determine the optimal zones to search for based onitem classification and UOM.Which method do I use to retrieve from these locations?'Pick to clean' method indicates that the system optimizes on a locationbecoming empty after quantity is retrieved, while also considering the leastamount of locations to pick from.'Least Pick' method indicates the system optimizes on the least number oflocations that satisfy the retrieval quantity.Retrieval ExecutionThe Sterling Warehouse Management System generates appropriate tasks for eachretrieval request. The Sterling Warehouse Management System Task Management isused to complete these tasks using printed move tickets, RF Mobile Terminal, or byintegrating with Material Handling Equipment (MHE).Execution of these tasks uses strategies that include:One request at a time—a user completes the request in one trip or multiple trips.Multiple requests at a time—a user completes tasks across requests in a singletrip for more efficiency purposes. (This is very similar to a batch pick scenario.)The Sterling Warehouse Management System can be used to control retrieval tasksuggestion by placing constraints based on a user or based on attributes such asshipment number or work order number. These are further described in TaskManagement.Retrieval VisibilityThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides complete visibility to thestatus of retrieval requests. The visibility is at a granular level indicating retrievalrequest and attributes used to initiate the request.The visibility to retrieval requests is provided through console. The SterlingWarehouse Management System also provides an audit trail views for the moverequest. The combination of attributes are illustrated through the following usecases or examples:View open retrieval requests for a work orderThe criteria used include department, status, work order numberView retrieval requests by outbound shipment number on a waveThe criteria used include department, shipment and wave numberView open retrieval requests for pallets or casesThe criteria used include unit of measure and statusView open retrieval requests created by the user that was expected to finish innext 30 minutesThe criteria used include department, status, and finish no later thanThe Sterling Warehouse Management System also allows the cancellation of anentire move request or the removal of a part of a move request."
Replenishment,"In a warehouse as product is removed from a location, the inventory in thatlocation requires re-stocking. This process is called as 'replenishment.'A warehouse consists of zones that are classified for multiple UOMs. For example,a zone that holds units with UOM as EACH or a zone that holds cases with UOMas CASE or a zone that holds pallets with UOM as pallet. The replenishmentstrategy would involve a multi-step strategy covering moves from pallet storage tocase storage or loose storage and from case storage to loose storage. This is called""multi-step replenishments"" as shown in the following figure. In a scenario, whereoffsite storage is used, the first step of replenishment is to the pallet storage,thereby increasing one more step in the process.The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports replenishments that arebased on demand or inventory levels. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemalso allows placing ad-hoc requests for replenishment of locations.In outbound planning, a replenishment request is created due to demand and thedemand causing the inventory of a SKU at a location to fall below its 'minimum'level. Demand is created from work orders in VAS, shipments and wave. Demandis also created by a manual move request.Inventory Level-Based ReplenishmentInventory level based replenishments are created based on inventory 'minimum'and 'maximum' levels defined at a location for a SKU and UOM. In a 3PLenvironment these levels may be specified at the company (enterprise) level.Inventory levels are periodically checked through inventory monitor. The strategiesused for inventory level based replenishment include Minimum/Maximum leveltriggers and top-off.Inventory monitor raises an event when the net inventory at a location falls belowthe minimum level, or when there is no inventory. A request is placed for retrievalbased on the event to replenish the location.In addition, if the request is for a top-off, all locations that are below the'maximum' level for the criteria specified are considered for replenishment.In both the strategies location is replenished to the 'maximum level'.(Replenishment Quantity = Max Capacity - Net Inventory).Typically, top-off replenishments are chosen as end-of-day shifts or during'graveyard' shifts."
Count,"Accuracy of inventory level is critical to a supply chain. Inventory levels are thekey to having better customer satisfaction, demand planning and lower labor costs.It is possible to reduce the human error factor while receiving and putaway ofinventory to a location in a warehouse, by introducing packaging restrictions thatinclude labeling, consistent marking and bar coding. Also, each move request inthe system requiring location and the package being scanned reduces human errorfurther.However, it is common that a customer or consumer may order in quantities thatis different from the package unit of measure. For example, shoes are usuallypacked in case packs. But, a consumer may order a single pair, which introducesthe requirement to break open the package and introduce some human handling ofproduct.There are two types of count namely, physical count and cycle count.Physical count is a process that is usually performed for a large area such as zone,or a warehouse. In physical count, users perform an inventory count typicallystopping down the warehouse. After this count, activities pertaining to thiswarehouse can be resumed, for example, putaway, replenishment, retrieval, and soon, which the user would have stopped before starting the physical count.Cycle count is a process that is performed periodically, usually for a small areasuch as location range. In cycle count, a user performs an inventory count withprocesses such as, putaway, replenishment, retrieval, and so on, runningsimultaneously.A count system allows you to carry out counts in a planned or ad hoc manner. Acommon type of count employed is year-end inventories. While this is exhaustive,it is also time consuming, and does not ensure accuracy throughout the year. Theother method is to only count items based on velocity or price every quarter.However, the best method is to ensure count performed periodically in the system.The count tasks may be either generated for a cycle count program, requested bythe inventory control department ad hoc, or be initiated through system eventsthat occur at a location level.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows count requests to be initiatedthrough console on an ad hoc basis. Count requests can be generated automaticallyfor a cycle count program that is employed at a node, or a set of nodes for anenterprise. System events like exception being recorded during an activityperformed like putaway, retrieval or pick, or a location quantity dropping belowminimum levels or at zero can also be used to initiate a count request.Some examples of different count requests include requests to count:A locationAn item, product class, and UOM combinationAll received products based on purchase order or shipment using the receiptnumberAn entire zoneA case or palletA product line or any other item classificationA region levelA node level or across nodesThe location level, aisle, or bay level within a zoneA range of locationsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System allows priority to be placed on acount request and allows to place date and time based conditions for start and/orfinish times. For example, user may request a count for a zone that has slowmoving items and requests for count to start the next day assigning a low priority.The start and end time allows for planning and tracking.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides inventory monitors thatraise events based on the location level activity for either minimum levels or alocation that is at zero quantity.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also requests users for confirmationwhenever it detects that a location is empty after picking. If the user specifies thatthe location is not empty, an event is triggered that creates a count request. Thisensures that a variance is detected at the earliest, even before the next cycle countis due. The confirmation is done during retrieval, replenishment, and picking. Theuser is not inconvenienced in any way; they can carry on with their allotted tasksafter confirmation.Tasks for a count request could be at a location, item, category of items, orcontainer level, or in any combination of those based the on level at which therequest was placed.Count ExecutionThe Sterling Warehouse Management System enables the counting of inventoryusing any of the following methods:Count inventory using paper—this methodology shows the user the currentinventory in a location, which can be altered while recording count.Count inventory real-time using RF mobile terminal—initially, this methodologyis used for counting a blind count, which does not show the user the currentsystem quantity. This methodology is the most accurate and exhaustive methodto ensure that all users perform count accurately. This also allows for real-timeinventory updates and the ability to interleave count tasks during the process ofa regular workday.In some warehouses, inventory is tracked at a tag number or serial number level.The count at these granular levels is cumbersome and requires opening ofpackages. In such situations, the Sterling Warehouse Management System allowsfor counting without specifying these granular attributes. However, varianceresolution of these tasks has to be done at the granular level.The following example explains count execution process:For locations that are double deep or even quadruple deep in a case or pallet withLPN scenario, it is not physically possible to scan each license plate. In such a case,the Sterling Warehouse Management System allows count to be recorded at theSKU level without scanning individual case or pallet with LPN.VarianceA variance can be classified as either resolvable or unresolvable based on thegranular level of inventory information provided by a user when counting. Whenthe user provides all the inventory details, such as physical count, tag number,serial number, expiry date, and so on, the system knows the exact currentinventory availability in the system. As a result, the variance can be resolved bythe system itself. If no granular information is available, the system is unable toidentify the new items and the missing items. For example, in a warehouse wherethe inventory is serially tracked, resolvable and unresolvable variances can beexplained in the following manner:If a count is performed and the number of items present in the system is equal,a variance does not occur.However, if a count is performed, and the count value is five, but the systemshows it as four, the extra item will be marked as unresolvable because the serialinformation about the extra item is not available. Because of this, in the nextlevel of counting, the user should scan the items to find the missing item, andafter finding it, should mark the item as resolvable.The count business process configuration allows for either another count task or avariance task to be generated. This is possible only if the quantity entered does notmatch the system quantity. Generation of another count task verifies the countcompleted by the first user. During this count system quantity is displayed.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows the following as a result of acount that has variance:Generate re-count task at a later timeAccept count and generate variance task for resolutionAccept count and adjust level of inventory only if acceptance criteria are met.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides acceptance criteria forvariance at an item classification and value level. For example, a variance withvalue greater than 1000 USD for an item classified as high-value item is notaccepted. But, a variance of less than 100 USD for low-value items are acceptedautomatically.The Sterling Warehouse Management System can be configured such that allvariances require manual acceptance. For example, 3PL where inventory ownershipis at a customer level, variance acceptance is completed through a console.A new count request can be made, if variances viewed are not acceptable.Count VisibilityThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides complete visibility to bothcount request status as well as count results at the appropriate granular level. Italso provides an ability to modify the count results after completion of the counttask. However, you cannot modify the count result after performing the countverification.Count Request VisibilityThe count request visibility is provided through console. Count requests aresearched for their status utilizing criteria. These combinations of attributes arebetter illustrated through use cases or examples, which include:View count request status made by a client user scheduled to end todayCriteria used includes Enterprise, Requesting user, Finish no later thanView all open high priority tasks for across all clientsCriteria used include Priority and status rangeView all open tasks due to complete in the next two hoursCriteria used include Enterprise, finish no later than and status rangeView all open count requests for an Item, UOMCriteria used includes Enterprise, Item ID, UOM and Status RangeView status of all recounts issued for a receiptCriteria used includes Enterprise, Receipt Number and Status RangeView all requests made for a zoneCriteria used includes enterprise, zone and maximum recordsView all requests made for a regionCriteria used is enterprises across nodesCount Result VisibilityThe count results visibility is provided through a console. Count results aresearched for their status utilizing criteria. These combinations of attributes arebetter illustrated through use cases or examples, which include:View latest count results for a particular enterpriseCriteria used includes ship node, enterprise, item ID, variance value as ’Any’and latest summary task flag selectedView all variances at the node that have exceeded a specified currency valueCriteria used include enterprise and variance value with 'greater than'View all positive variances for a particular item, UOMCriteria used include enterprise, item, UOM and check 'Positive' variance valueView all variances for a particular enterpriseCriteria used include enterprise and check 'Any' variance value"
Inbound Planning,"Many companies track their inbound planning and procurement costs in anattempt to reduce the cost of goods sold. The opportunity to reduce costs areenhanced by better visibility to both inventory holding and goods in transit,optimized transportation and lower labor costs.A warehouse has visibility to inbound inventory upon creation of purchase orderor transfer order. A merchandising or purchasing system owns the purchase order.A transfer order is initiated as an inter-warehouse transfer or a transfer aftermanufacturing process is complete.The interaction between various participants in the supply chain may be achievedthrough collaboration or by manual methods. IBM Sterling Supply Collaborationachieves this by tracking the purchase order from the individual participant to thedestination.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides Web-based, real-timevisibility of the incoming inventory to a warehouse. This is achieved bydownloading the inbound order from the appropriate host, either externalmerchandising or purchasing systems or from IBM Sterling Supply Collaboration."
Shipment and Dock Scheduling,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System maintains and tracks shipment (ASN- Advanced Ship Notice) details from various sources. This provides a warehousevisibility to the Expected Time of Arrival (ETA). The Sterling WarehouseManagement System has the ability to track shipment at all points in the supplychain. This enhanced visibility to shipment in the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem is used to prepare dock doors for receiving.A shipment or inbound order contains item information and the expected quantity.There are situations when a shipment or inbound order contains additional details,such as case or pallet with LPN, lot numbers and serial numbers.A carton can have SKU labels or a case with LPN label associated. These labels aregenerated at the origin warehouse or through the web through collaborationsoftware. The pre-printed labels are industry practices employed to standardizeinventory. It improves inventory accuracy and reduces labor costs. However, theSterling Warehouse Management System allows for the manual creation ofshipment when the information is not available electronically.Once a shipment has been marked as shipped but before it has left the warehouse,a shipment can be unshipped and placed back into the status it was previously inbefore the shipment was marked as shipped.The Dock Scheduling functionality of the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemenables you to manage all dock locations in a warehouse for receiving inboundshipments and shipping outbound shipments. The dock scheduling rules enablesthe user to specify number of days in advance to take a dock appointment.schedule with a shipment or load. If scheduling is done for a shipment, theSterling Warehouse Management System provides complete visibility into theshipment volume, weight, number of cartons available, and pallet information.Based on the Productivity Metrics (SAM definition), the duration of theappointment is also suggested.Dock scheduling is based on the warehouse calendar associated with a dock andconsiders all working days and holidays, and shifts that are valid for receiving orshipping operations. Each dock can have its own calendar and shifts specifiedwhen they are available. You may also exclude certain docks from the schedulingprocess. For example, a warehouse may allocate one dock for UPS fluid loading,which may require one full day. In this case, dock appointment is not required forUPS fluid loading.Each appointment is assigned a unique reference number. The time slot assignedfor each appointment may vary based on the shipment size. For example, theduration for one appointment could be for 30 minutes and another appointmentcould vary between 45 minutes to 1 hour. Appointments can be changed to afuture date in case the delivery fails. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemcreates alerts for such missed deliveries or pickups to ensure that newappointments are created. The Sterling Warehouse Management System alsoenables the cancellation of appointments that are already taken.Due to additional resource constraints, a warehouse may not want to take morethan a certain number of appointments at a given time. For example, if 20 docksare available for taking appointments, a warehouse may not want to schedule all20 docks from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, as it may not be possible for a warehouse tounload all 20 trucks at the same time.Appointments can be taken only for the number of days specified in advance.Shipment and Inbound Order VisibilityThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides visibility to shipment andpurchase orders expected into a warehouse. Visibility is provided at a shipmentnumber level, purchase order number level inclusive of the status. The SterlingWarehouse Management System business process configuration allows to track allincoming shipments at each step in the supply chain. The combination of attributesis detailed through the following use cases or examples:View all shipments that are in-transit after clearing local customsCriteria used includes statusView all purchase orders for a particular item expected shortlyCriteria used include document type, item and statusView all transfer orders that have been shipped from the regional warehouseCriteria used includes document type, status range and origin nodeView status of a particular shipmentCriteria used include shipment number or a combination of tracking attributessuch as Pro number, BOL number or trailer numberView status of all purchase orders from a vendorCriteria used include document type and the seller"
Inbound Execution,"Inbound execution is the completion of inbound planning process, which is receiptand putaway of inventory. Inbound execution is one of the most critical factorsthat directly influence the throughput of a warehouse. The impact of where andhow inventory is stored in a warehouse directly influences the time taken toputaway, replenish and pick inventory. There is a significant amount of time that isspent in warehouse layout and configuration based on the type of inventoryreceived, how the inventory is received, and the equipment used to receive andputaway inventory.The receiving process in a warehouse involves acceptance of goods from the carrierand then the physical process of checking and receipt of inventory. The process ofacceptance is to verify number of packages (cases or pallets) against the bill oflading or packing slip that the carrier provides. If an ASN is available for theshipment received, a preprinted sheet is used to verify the contents. The processused to receive inventory into a warehouse is completed through Radio Frequency(RF) Mobile Terminal, console or MHE like a receiving sorter.For some inventory that is received in a warehouse the pre-packaging steps has tobe performed before putaway. For example, in the parts industry, screws arereceived in large boxes or bags and are packaged into appropriate inventory UOMpacks before putaway. These pre-packaging activities requires a different locationto be allocated in a warehouse. The ability to automate these procedures based onthe SKU being received significantly reduces labor requirement.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides comprehensive functionalityto effectively manage inventory execution process. It also provides completevisibility to specific shipment available in the supply chain. The SterlingWarehouse Management System also enhances this visibility by tracking theacceptance of inventory from a carrier. This feature of the Sterling WarehouseManagement System enables warehouses to pre-receive product based on thenumber of packages (cases or pallets) received and routes these packages to theappropriate business area. The Sterling Warehouse Management System businessprocess configuration allows modeling of the physical process in a warehouse.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also permits diversion of inventoryreceived into the appropriate area based on quality profiles, cross-dockrequirements or putaway preferences. It also allows to model a warehouseindividually or distinctly from the other warehouses based on its layout and MHEdeployments.The information captured during the receiving process is visible through consolesfor audit as well as tracking purposes. The ability to track individual activities in awarehouse allow for productivity tracking and reporting."
Pre-Receipt,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System pre-receipt process enables ashipment to be marked as received at the package level. This process is followed inwarehouses that have large receiving yard or area where shipments are offloadedbefore the receiving department starts the shipment work.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows recording of shipment levelattributes during pre-receiving process that include trailer details and driverdetails. In addition, the actual date and time of pre-receipt is recorded to trackcarrier performance."
Receiving Preferences,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows to control receipt process withthe information that is available in a warehouse. It also supports the leastautomated warehouse through paper-based process and all warehouses up to themost automated, involving MHE for receipts. These warehouses howeverdisparate, are modeled individually in the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemnetwork.A warehouse can identify its own receiving preferences to characterize the flow ofinventory from the receiving dock to other departments and zones of a warehouse.A receipt in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is made for a purchaseorder level or shipment level. The Sterling Warehouse Management System holds acase or pallet with LPN details at a shipment level, if available. It also supportsblind receipts. Blind receipts are inventory that arrives in a warehouse without anyinformation. A warehouse may use any or all of these methods to receive itsinventory. The Sterling Warehouse Management System places constraints for eachof these methods.Quality profiles and SKU attributes influence the diversion of inventory to variousareas of a warehouse. In addition, if there is a demand for a certain product orquantity, the Sterling Warehouse Management System creates cross-dock diversionsduring receipt. In addition, if there is a demand for a certain product or quantity,the Sterling Warehouse Management System creates move requests for diversion tothe appropriate department during receipt. The diversions are displayed at thetime of receipt of the container or SKU to place inventory received into appropriatepallets for putaway.The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports planning for QC orcross-dock diversions for an item. These planned diversions could be for a specificinbound order or shipment, or across inbound orders or shipments.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides inventory receipt in awarehouse at most granular level. It also supports inventory receiving at an SKUand UOM level, case or pallet with LPN level. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System has the ability to create new case or pallet with LPN, ifnecessary.The receipt completion creates inventory at both location and warehouse levels.The Sterling Warehouse Management System uniquely identifies inventory by theattributes captured during the receiving process. For more information about inventory attributes, see the topic, Inventory Control and Tracking. The SterlingWarehouse Management System provides visibility and tracking through consolesfor receipt and inventory audits."
Receiving Exceptions,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks inventory receipt at a purchaseorder level or shipment level, and also maintains case or pallet with LPN leveldetails.The exception types that occur in a warehouse include receipt after the expecteddate, receipt of items that do not exist in the shipment, overages, shortages ordamaged inventory. The Sterling Warehouse Management System tracks visibilityof quantity received against a shipment that allows for overages or shortages to betracked. This allows to track performance against a vendor.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also records receipts againstshipments and enables to correct manual receipt data entry errors. Thesemodifications are reflected against a shipment or a purchase order."
Receipt Putaway,"The receipt of a product initiates requests for diversion of product for putaway.Receiving preferences controls the timing of when a putaway request is generated.The request is generated when a receipt is complete or when the completeshipment has been received.During putaway, the Sterling Warehouse Management System considers thepreferences that are set up at an item and location level. This is completed onMobile Terminal, or batch sheets, or integrated with MHE. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System RF Mobile Terminal task management controls task execution.A warehouse configuration may require inventory availability to be tied to whenputaway is complete. The Sterling Warehouse Management System achieves this byusing inventory status at the zone level as inventory availability is tied toinventory status. The task management of the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem utilizes this to move inventory to the appropriate inventory status."
Close Receipt,"The closure of a receipt indicates completion of receipt against the ASN orshipment, and uploading of information to the host systems. The SterlingWarehouse Management System enables both manual and automatic closure ofreceipt. Manual closure of a receipt is initiated through a console. Automaticclosure is based on business process configuration that checks for conditions, suchas full receipt of quantity, excess quantity has been received, or putawaycompletion. The Sterling Warehouse Management System initiates closure of areceipt typically as an end of day process based on the warehouse requirements."
Receipt Visibility,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides visibility to all receipts atmost granular level. The visibility is provided at a level at which inventory hasbeen received into a warehouse.The visibility is provided through a console at shipment, receipt or purchase orderlevel. Visibility into the audit trail is provided through inventory audit console.The following use cases or examples explain the combination of attributes in theSterling Warehouse Management System:View all inventory for a specific shipment or purchase order numberCriteria used include Enterprise, Reference number as inbound shipmentnumber or PO numberView all receipts that are in progress at a warehouseCriteria used include enterprise, ship node and statusView particular shipment or purchase order serial numberCriteria used include enterprise, serial number"

It provides tools foreffective monitoring and management of application components. It provides thecapabilities to manage the extended enterprise network with critical security,internationalization and localization, and system management capabilities.The application framework also allows the extension of Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation data model to support unique data needs of yourimplementation.You can extend Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation by changing theon-screen elements of the user interfaces, modifying printed documents, or addingcolumns to the database tables."
User Interface Extensibility,"User Interface extensibility allows you to change the way information is rendered,or displayed, without changing the way it functions. You can customize the lookand feel of the Application Console and the Applications Manager which make upthe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation user interface:Application Console - the standard GUI for creating, tracking, and viewingorders, item inventory, and returnsApplications Manager - the graphical user interface for configuring SterlingSelling and Fulfillment FoundationThis is accomplished through a combination of configuration changes through theApplications Manager and HTML code changes to the JSP files.Additionally, you can extend the look and feel of Printed documents.Application Consoles User Interface ExtensibilityThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation Presentation Framework allowsyou to extend the user interface of the standard Application Consoles.The standard Application Consoles user interface uses HTML embedded withinJava Server Pages. The UI layer goes through the Service Definition Framework toaccess the APIs, which ensures that only exposed APIs are used.The user interface layer of the Service Definition Framework uses very minimalXML manipulation. Wherever significant manipulation of XML output becomesnecessary, changes to the APIs provide a more user interface friendly output.The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation Presentation Framework providesyou with the capabilities to extend the standard Application Consoles userinterface in the following ways:Customize the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation Sign In screen - thefirst page a user sees when they start Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationin the following ways: Set the locale setting to determine the language in which on-screen literals aredisplayed Configure locale-specific logins - for multilingual user communities, it makessense to display the login page in every possible language Establish a corporate look and feel - a secondary purpose of the Sign Inscreen is to introduce the corporate look and feel that follows throughout theapplication Sign in from an external application - when integrating Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation with external applications, you can automatically loga user into Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation from the externalapplication Support single sign-on - users can log into Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation transparently using a domain password. Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation supports third-party single sign-on applicationsAdd corporate branding - you can change the branding logos displayed onscreen in the following locations: Login Screen (Sign In Window) Menu Bar About BoxDefine a theme - a theme defines the look and feel, for example fonts and colors,of the applicationCustomize views - screen layout and organization for the following types ofviews: Search Views List Views Detail ViewsCustomize business entitiesAdd lookups - you can add lookups that allow users to choose from anassortment of options rather than typing in dataAdd graphs and pie charts - graphs and pie charts allow users to view agraphical representation of dataCustomize menu structure - When creating customized screens, you need makesure that users can access them, either through a menu structure or throughnavigationCustomize the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation images - you cancustomize the Images used throughout Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation which appear in the following places:Menu barMenuApplication ConsoleCustomize screen navigation - you can customize how users navigate fromentity to entity by configuring link or action resourcesCreate custom event handlers - you can create and plug in custom client-sidevalidations to user interface controls at control- or screen-levelCreate screens for custom document typesCreate custom transactions - you can create custom order or deliverytransactions and configure the pipelines to include these transactions to dostatus changesXML binding - developers can easily form the input necessary to pass to an APIand populate a screen with the output of the APIApplications Manager ExtensibilityThe Applications Manager user interface was developed in Swing. The mainpurpose of user interface extensibility is to allow any database extensions to beintegrated into the graphical user interface.Extensibility includes the following modifications:Adding any buttons and labelsAdding any text fields and check boxes -Hiding any non-mandatory componentsReorganizing the components that are displayed on-screenCreating or modifying user themesYou may modify the following types of screens:Search screensDetail screensList screens - you can add, remove, and re-arrange columns in the list screenwithin the Applications Manager.Screens that contain only a Tree structure are not extensible."
Database Extensibility,"Database extensibility enables you to add columns to the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation tables to capture and maintain additional data. You canextend certain Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation tables by adding one ormore columns to the table.Additionally, you may encounter a situation where you have dynamically changingfields for special orders. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation enables you toextend order- and line-level information that is captured on the system by addingorder or order line-related attributes. This allows you to capture company-specificflat and hierarchical data. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation APIstransparently provide access to such data to ensure that all changes to the datamodel are automatically integrated into Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. These attributes do not appear in the default user interface and arenot searchable. However, you may customize the user interface to include suchfields."
Security Management,"Security Management enables you to ensure that each user accesses only theinformation that is appropriate for carrying out their tasks. the resources providedby the organization to which they belong. A user is limited to access only thoseresources to which they have permission.For more information about installation level security, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Installation Guide.UsersA user is a single person assigned with a certain task, such as, Hub Administratoror Customer Service Representative (CSR), depending on what role they play inthe organization. Each organization has its own users.User GroupsA user group is a collection of users who perform a similar task. For example, agroup of Customer Service Representatives might be collectively placed in a CSRuser group. Users can belong to multiple user groups. Permissions are assigned toa user group. A user retains all permissions for each user group to which he or shebelongs.Each organization has its own user groups. User groups can only contain users forthe same organization of which the user was created, except in the case of a usergroup created by the Hub organization, which can contain users of anyorganization.TeamsA team is a collection of users who have common data access requirements. Teamscan have access to specific document types, Enterprises, ship nodes, andcustomers. If a user is not associated with a team, that user is considered to havethe least restrictive access, or default access. By defining a team, you can furtherrestrict the access to any Enterprises, document types, or ship nodes that are asub-set of the default access list. For more information about teams and how youcan use them in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, see “CustomerManagement” on page 30.Resources and Resource PermissionsSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation consists of many resources, includingscreens, functions, URLs, and so on, for which permissions can be granted orrevoked.Through Security Management user groups are granted access rights topredetermined Resources. A user is limited to access only those resources that havebeen permitted to at least one of the user groups of which the user is a member."
Security of Sensitive Information in Log Files,"For information about how to mask sensitive information in log files, refer to theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Properties Guide."
Data Access Policies,"If you want to use your own access rules, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Javadocs.Access Policy ModesSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation access rules are applied via thefollowing access policy modes:Enterprise User - this user belongs to the Enterprise that brokers business. EachEnterprise can contain multiple organizations that are assigned various roles.Buyer User - this user belongs to the organization that purchases products froman Enterprise or other seller organizations.Seller User - this user belongs to the organization that supplies products to theEnterprise or other buyer organizations.Node User - this user belongs to an organization that represents a physicallocation, whether it is a manufacturing plant, small stock room, or warehouse.In addition to user access policy modes, Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundationCatalog Access PoliciesCatalog access policies are applied when the user manages catalog data, such asitems, categories, and attributes. If the user is only viewing catalog data, catalogaccess policies are not applied.Catalog access policies will only be applied if the user is an enterprise user or acatalog organization user.A catalog organization user can manage data for the user’s own organization or forthe organizations administered by the user’s organization. However, a catalogorganization user cannot manage data for subcatalog organizations. Similarly, asubcatalog organization user can manage data for the user’s own organization orfor the organizations administered by the user’s organization.For example, if an item is owned by a catalog organization (that is, there is nosubcatalog organization on the item), the item cannot be managed by a subcatalogorganization user. However, if an item is owned by a subcatalog organization (thatis, there is a subcatalog organization on the item), it can only be managed by asubcatalog organization user.Item entitlements can also be applied to access policies based on the purpose. Foritem entitlement, access policies still get applied, even if the user is only viewingitem entitlements. For example, buying entitlements (purpose is buying) can onlybe viewed and managed by an enterprise user. Selling entitlements (purpose isselling) can only be viewed and managed by a catalog organization user.Pricing Access PoliciesPricing access policies will only be applied if the user is an enterprise user, a seller,or a pricing organization user. Any user playing these roles can manage pricingdata for the user’s own organization or for the organizations administered by theuser’s organization.Users can see all price lists defined by their pricing organization, but they canmodify only the price lists of their own pricing organization. For example, ifXYZ-MA and XYZ-CA use XYZ-MA as a pricing organization, an XYZ-CA user cansee all price lists defined by XYZ-MA, but only users of XYZ-MA can modify thoseprice lists.Access policies are applied to transactional and master data only. Access policiesare not applied to configuration data, such as organization and users.Levels of User AccessA user may log into an application in any of the above user roles. For example, auser could log in as a buyer to look at sales orders, or as a seller to look atpurchase orders. You could configure Enterprise User access for an internalstorefront administrator, or Node User access for a warehouse administrator whowants to see all the nodes in the organization.Each data access mode offers flexible levels of user access, such as access to allcustomers assigned to a team or only to customers directly assigned to that user.Access can also be extended to descendant teams and descendant customers,depending on the access mode.Figure 1 is an example of a business that does not want to assign CSRs to specificaccounts, but rather assigns entire teams to accounts. For more information aboutteams, see “Teams” on page 10.Figure 2 on page 13 shows an example of a business with two enterprises: one forretail and one for small-to-medium businesses. These two enterprises have separateCSR teams. They mix their use of the data access features by letting the retailenterprise, E1, see any enterprise, while the other enterprise, E2, must assign itsCSRs to particular accounts.Figure 3 shows the organizational structure of a soft drink business that is buyingtelephony equipment from HIJ Telephone Corporation. In this Buyer scenario, TheSODA Beverages Division (3) can buy telephone equipment for itself and itsdescendent organizations, Soft Drinks (6), Fruit Drinks (7), and Energy Drinks (8).Alternatively, the Data Access features could be used to exclude one of thedescendants, Energy Drinks (8) from the organizations that the SODA BeveragesDivision (3) can buy telephones for.You can configure all data access policies in the of the Applications Manager.Figure 4 on page 14 shows the organizational structure of XYZ Corporation, whichis a customer of an office supply company. The East, Central, and West offices arechild organizations of XYZ Corporation and are also customers of the office supplycompany. In this buyer scenario, Buyer User 1 is assigned to the East and Westoffices, and Buyer User 2 is assigned to the Central and West offices. Buyer useraccess policies are configured to provide buyer users with access to assignedcustomers only. Thus, Buyer 1 can purchase supplies for the East and Central offices, and Buyer User 2 can purchase supplies for the Central and West offices.You can configure all data access policies in the of the Applications Manager."
Password Policies,"The password policy broadly governs the following:Password strength - This includes the length (minimum and maximum) of thepassword, special characters in the password, and password reuse.Password generation - This includes generating a password during user creation,frequency of password expiration, failed login attempts, and user roles that mayaffect the password policy.Password reset - This includes resetting of passwords through differentprotocols, such as e-mail or SMS.In addition, password policy configuration denies access to users (locks them out)in case of repeated invalid login attempts.For additional information about password policies, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Password Policy Management ."
Password Encryption,Passwords in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation database areautomatically protected from potential attackers by a secure hash algorithm.The system protects users' passwords by first appending a string of randomcharacters (salt) to each password. The salted password is then hashed and storedin the database. The system stores SHA-256 hash with 16 bytes of salt (randomdata) for each password.The YCPValidateChangedPasswordUE and YCPCheckPasswordsMatchUE userexits can be implemented to provide customized hashing logic.
JMS Security for JBoss,"Securing the JBoss JMS Queue provides security to the data stored in queues onapplication servers. For JBoss, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation providesonly JMS Queue-based security. While connecting to a secured JMS Queue, youwill need to pass the username and password for authentication.You can configure JMS security for JBoss by setting up the JBoss DefaultMessaging JMS Queue transport node available in the Applications Manager. Formore information about JBoss Default Messaging JMS Queue node, see the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.You should also secure the JMS queue on the JBoss application server."
API Security,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides authentication for API callsfor a given user ID, a certificate, or both. It allows you to control what APIresources can be accessed when an API is called.When calling an API, you can provide following two levels of security:Authentication with a user ID, a certificate or both. The login API is calledbefore any other API is called. The user authentication is done prior to API call.The access can be restricted to a subset of APIs or Services for a given user.Authorization, which verifies which resources you can access. The authorizationrestricts the user to a subset of APIs and Services. This authorization is done atthe API level for all APIs, regardless of where that API is invoked from. Thisauthorization is completely independent of UI resource security. For example,say a user has access through the UI to a screen that lists users. The screeninvokes the getUserList API. In order for the screen to work for that user, theymust have access to the getUserList API.For more information on how to configure API security, refer to Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide."
System Management,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation you can manage integration andagent servers, view the properties of your application servers, enable databasecaching, and increase trace log output for APIs, user exits, services, and agents.The System Management module provides features to administer and monitorvarious components that make up Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. TheSystem Management Console provides a complete picture of Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation while it is running. Additionally, the health monitor agentcan alert system administrators when a problem happens such as an applicationserver going down or an agent server not processing tasks.Additionally, to enable the Applications Manager to obtain the model informationfor items from the Visual Modeler application, you can specify the location wherethe models, properties, and rules are stored.Other features include the following:View real-time statistical information to understand what is happening inSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation at any momentMonitor application servers for status and response time.Monitor APIs for response timeMonitor agents for status and number of pending tasks to ensure a bottleneck isnot createdMonitor JMS queues to ensure messages are being processed properlyShutdown, suspend, or resume agent and integration serversClear database cacheTrace APIs, agents, user exits, services, and the Application ConsolesCollect and persist statistical data"
Queue Management,"Queue Management enables the configuration of queues to notify users whenalerts are raised by the system. These alerts can come in different formatsincluding e-mail, faxes, and so on. Alerts are sent to different queues depending onthe type of alert.An alert is a message directed to a user or queue about a transaction that needsmanual intervention.Queues are configured to distribute alerts to users. You determine which usersreceive different alert types by assigning them to queues. You can also set up alertpriority and actions raised when certain conditions are met for the alert.In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation you can manage alerts, set thepriority for the alerts, enable the system to automatically assign an alert to a user,classify the alerts as one or more types, route the alert to a specific queue by alerttype, add notes to an alert, and specify a context sensitive resolution screen for thealert.You can enable the system to automatically assign an alert to a user instead ofsomeone having to go and manually assign an alert. You can classify alerts as oneor more types and use these types to:Default attributes (like default follow up time and priority) onto an alert.Specify a context sensitive resolution screen for the alert.You can specify the priority, queue, expiration days, follow-up hours, resolutionform, and user for the various alerts types in the configuring alerts component ofthe Applications Manager. For more information about configuring alerts service,see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Application Platform ConfigurationGuide.Alert ConsolidationAlerts can be raised under different situations and in a number of circumstancesthe content of the new raised alert is the same as an existing alert. For example, amonitor triggers an alert based on an order condition. The order does not changefor a certain duration and another alert is raised. Instead of having numerousidentical alerts you can consolidate the alerts using the alert consolidation method.You can enable alert consolidation in the Service Definition Framework Alertcomponent. This consolidation is available everywhere regardless of where thealert is raised, including APIs, service builders and error handling. For more information about enabling alert consolidation, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.When an alert is raised and consolidation is enabled, the database is queried tofind any other alerts with identical information. If such an alert exists aconsolidation count is incremented on the existing alert and new record is notinserted into the database.To identify the attributes used for consolidation, a consolidation template can bepassed as part of the input to the API being called. This template contains allattributes that must be the same in the input XML and the database beforeconsolidation takes place. If a template is not passed, then a default template isused, consisting of many of the Inbox attributes and all of the extended attributes.This default template can be found in <INSTALL_DIR>/repository/xapi/template/merged/resource/exceptionConsolidation.xml, and can be extended in the sameway as API templates. For more information about extending the API templates,see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Extending the Database.A consolidation window is set to consolidate alerts by the Day or the Hour. Whenthe date attributes in the consolidation template are compared with the databasevalues this consolidation window is used to determine whether they are equal. Theconsolidation window matches a record within a discrete time interval and areoutlined below with an example.Consolidation by HourFor example, consider that the consolidation window is set to HOUR and thetimestamp of the last occurred alert is 2005-02-01, 06:24 AM. A similar alert israised on 2005-02-01, 7:10 AM. This new alert raised at 7:10 AM is not consolidatedwith the alert raised at 6:24 AM even though the alerts are less than an hour apart.Hence for consolidating these alerts, they must occur within the same hour.Consolidation by DayFor example, consider the consolidation window is being set to DAY and the lastoccurred alert was on 2005-02-01, 07:40 PM. Even though a new alert is raised at2005-02-02 1:30 AM, this is not consolidated with the previous alert since they wereraised on different days.Note: If the consolidation template has only non-time attributes then theconsolidation window (hourly or daily) would have no effect on the consolidationprocess.The consolidation window is applied to all timestamp fields that are included inthe consolidation template including any extended fields.The following are the assumptions and limitations of consolidating the alerts:If the alerts are consolidated, no alert attribute fields are updated other than theconsolidation count and the last occurred time of the alert.If there are multiple alerts that match the same consolidation template the exactalert that get chosen for matching is undefined.Alerts cannot be consolidated on any child tables or extended hang-off tables.You cannot enable conditional consolidation based on the data. For example, youcannot choose to consolidate only when EnterpriseKey is DEFAULT.Closed alerts are not used for consolidation. You can specify the expiration days for the alerts in the alert service of theApplications Manager. The expiration days represent the number of days of noactivity after which this exception may be automatically closed. A value of zeromeans the exception does not expire."
Print Extensibility,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows you to create custom labelsand prints by configuring with Loftware Print Server and Loftware Label Managersystems. The print services are customized by creating service definition to beinvoked from an event or the console user interface.

Alert Management,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation you can:Configure alertsCreate new exception typesSet the priority for the exception typesClassify each exception as one or more typesRoute an exception type to a specific alert queueSpecify the threshold for high priority alertsSpecify the expiration days and follow-up hours for an exception typeSpecify whether or not to consolidate exceptions of the typeYou can classify exceptions as one or more types and use these types to:Default attributes (such as default follow-up time and priority) for an exceptiontypeSpecify a context-sensitive resolution screen for an exception typeSpecify a configuration screen for an exception typeSpecify a list screen for an exception typeYou can define additional configurations for an exception type. For example, PCAsmay want to capture additional information such as Credit Limit for which theycan specify the configuration form used to capture the required information. PCAscan also specify a list form, which provides a list of alerts defined for a specific exception type. You can also associate exception types to an application, such as aPCA, and a role, such as BUYER or SELLER, that an application supports at theHUB level.You can configure one or more exception types and its priority for an organization.You can route the exception to the appropriate alert queue by configuring arouting rule for the exception type. You can also create one or more routing rulesfor each exception type configured for an organization. When creating routingrules for an organization level exception type, you can specify the routing logicthat you want to use to raise an alert. More than one alert may be raised based onthe routing logic used. The routing logic determines the queue to which theexception needs to be assigned. The routing rules indicate the type of routing. Fora given exception type, you can use a different type of routing rule or logic.When creating routing rules for an organization-level exception type, you can alsospecify whether or not to send an e-mail to the specified e-mail address. If therouting type ""Use Department's Queue"" is used, for which e-mail needs to be sent,and if an e-mail ID is not specified in the exception routing rule, the system checksthe configuration of the department for an e-mail ID. When an exception is createdon a default queue of the department, an e-mail is sent to the e-mail configured forthe department. If the template is not configured, a default template is used.For more information about configuring alerts, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide."
Organization Modeling,"An organization represents a company, department, cost center, division, sales unitor any other organizational unit within a business. Typical organizations are asfollows:Business GroupCompanyLegal EntitySales OrganizationPurchasing OrganizationPlant and WarehouseBusiness GroupA business group is typically the highest level in the organization hierarchy. It hasno accounting impact. It consists of one or more companies.CompanyA company typically represents a global brand name and is the organizational unitfor which individual financial statements are created according to the relevant legalrequirements. A company may have one or more legal entities.Legal EntityA legal entity represents an organization unit identified by local governments asoperating units and are typically instituted for every country a business operatesin. This organizational unit is typically self-contained and set of accounts can bedrawn up for external reporting. This involves recording all relevant transactionsand generating all supporting documents for financial statements, such as balancesheets and profit and loss statements.Sales OrganizationA sales organization is responsible for sales and distribution of products andservices. Sales organizations can be defined based on the following characteristics:Sales channel - for example, wholesale, retail or direct sale.Product Line - for example, electronics, entertainment, and service.Geography - the geography of the ship-to location of orders. For example,east-coast or west-coast.Customer - (major customers).A combination of one or more of the above.Purchasing OrganizationA purchasing organization (also known as a Buyer organization) is responsible forplacing purchase orders to vendors to replenish raw materials and products in acompany's locations. Purchasing organizations could be created centrally or can beassociated with each legal entity or sales organization. Purchasing organizationscan also be modeled based on product lines, geography, or vendors.Plant and WarehousePlants and warehouses are physical locations where goods are manufactured orstored for distribution. Typically, a plant or a warehouse is owned by a legal entity.A business can have many plants or warehouses associated in almost allcombinations to its sales and purchasing organizations.A warehouse could be designated to store products for a single sales organizationor could service multiple sales organizations based on the sales organizationstructures (product-based, geography-based, customer-based). A single purchasingorganization may be responsible for buying raw materials for a plant or stockingproduct into a warehouse or multiple purchasing organizations could be involvedwith a single plant or warehouse (purchasing based on geography or product).In a third-partly logistics (3PL) company or in some rare cases with a business, aspecific location can store inventory for multiple legal entities or companies. In thiscase, typically, the 3PL company is the owner of the inventory stocking location."
Organization Modeling in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, an ""organization"" represents anyunit of a business whether it is a company, legal entity, a business group, salesorganization, purchasing organization or warehouse. Departments and divisionswould also be represented as an organization in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation. Organizations can be defined in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation in a hierarchical structure. Organization hierarchies are used inmultiple places in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation to inheritconfigurations and other business rules. Even customers and vendors are definedas multi-level organizations. “Customer and Vendor Definitions” on page 27discusses customer and vendor modeling in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation.When defining Participants of your organizational model in Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation, in addition to assigning organization roles, anyorganization can be designated as having the following responsibilities:EnterpriseCatalog OrganizationInventory OrganizationCapacity OrganizationAn organization can be defined with any or all of the above responsibilities at thesame time.EnterpriseAn Enterprise represents the organization that owns and controls all transactions inSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. An Enterprise in Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation controls the flow of documents (such as a sales order) andis considered the owner of the document. Most business rules and fulfillmentprocesses for an order is defined by the enterprise. On a sales order, the Enterpriseis also assigned the role of the Seller organization in most cases. Similarly, forpurchase orders, an Enterprise is also assigned the role of the Buyer organizationin most cases. In some cases, if a higher level organizational unit wants to controland enforce business rules or document flow of all its subsidiaries, thatorganizational unit is assigned an Enterprise role and its subsidiary organizationsare assigned Seller and Buyer roles.Even though most business rules are controlled by the Enterprise, pricing rules arealways controlled by the seller organization in both sales and purchase situations.In an organization hierarchy, multiple organizations can be designated as anEnterprise. However, every organization in the organizational structure needs toeither be defined as an Enterprise or have an organization designated as itsprimary Enterprise. This is necessary so that at all times Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation can clearly identify the set of rules to be applied to thisorganization. (Even though this primary Enterprise relationship is established, anorganization can participate with another Enterprises on an individual transactionbasis).Every transactional document (order, shipment, load) in Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation requires a designated Enterprise.Catalog OrganizationA Catalog Organization represents an organization level in the organizationhierarchy at which an item master is defined. A catalog organization provides anyof the following functions:Item master definition. Even in a multi-level organizational structure, an itemmaster is typically defined at a very high level in the hierarchy. This allows allother organizations to share one common item master definition; eliminating theneed to create a separate definition of their own.A mechanism to separate item master definitions of two distinct organizations.For example a 3PL scenario and companies under the business group acquiredthrough a merger and acquisition (M&A). Same product identifiers couldrepresent completely separate physical products across two catalogorganizations.A mechanism to cross-reference product identifiers through usage of GlobalTrade Identification Number (GTIN).Catalog Organizations can have one or more catalogs (such as master catalogs).However, an item can be defined in only one master catalog. A master catalogrepresents a product line in most scenarios. In organizations where divisions arecreated based solely on product, a master catalog could represent a division.Typically the Catalog Organization is designated at the company level.Inventory OrganizationAn Inventory Organization represents an organization level in the organizationhierarchy at which all inventory information is consolidated. An InventoryOrganization provides any of the following functions:Inventory identification for a product. Different organizations could havedifferent product identifiers for the same inventory item. Inventory organizationprovides a mechanism to rationalize these product identifications into a singlenomenclature across multiple organizations. This allows a consistent global viewof a product across organization hierarchies and enables better decision makingfor the business.Establishes ownership of inventory when a single physical location is sharedacross multiple organizations without having the need to create multiple logicallocations to establish the inventory ownership (for example, 3PL scenarios)Inventory separation. All organizations that are defined as part of the sameInventory Organization have visibility to inventory of all other organizationsthat are part of this inventory organization. This allows better visibility acrossorganizations but can also create data security and other issues. An InventoryOrganization creates a separate silo of inventory definitions in the system. Thissilo cannot be accessed by organizations belonging to a different silo and thusprovide a complete segregation of inventory.All organizations must either be defined as an Inventory Organization or mustdesignate another organization as their Inventory Organization. An InventoryOrganization designated for an organization should share the same CatalogOrganization. This ensures that appropriate cross-referencing can be made to arriveat the inventory identification of an item. This also ensures that two separatephysical items do not create a situation where they have the same inventoryidentifier within the inventory module and thus can't be differentiated.Also note that, if the sales organization legal entity is not the same legal entityassociated with the physical location from where the product is being sourced,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation has the capability to automaticallygenerate a purchase order (created as chained order) to ensure proper inventoryownership transfers. This is done even though the Inventory Organization iscommon. In some cases, this is not desirable - as in the case of a 3PL where thephysical location is owned by the 3PL organization and does not indicate realinventory ownership. This can be prevented in one of the following two ways:Designate a node as a ""3PL"" node to suppress such chained order creations.Flag the owner organization of the node as ""chained order not required"".Typically, the legal entity in an organization hierarchy is designated as theInventory Organization for all subsidiary organizations.Capacity OrganizationA Capacity Organization represents an organization level in the organizationhierarchy at which all capacity information is consolidated. A capacity organizationprovides any of the following functions:Defines service slots for order promising functions.Capacity separation. All organizations that are part of the same CapacityOrganization have visibility to the capacity of all resources that are part of thisCapacity Organization. This allows a better visibility across resources but canalso create data security and other issues. A Capacity Organization creates aseparate silo of capacity definition in the system. This silo cannot be accessed byorganizations belonging to a different silo and thus provide a completesegregation of capacity.Enterprise OnboardingThe framework provides the ability to bring new enterprises on board the existingconfiguration. It also helps you separate the existing organizations from newerorganizations, and reduces the incidence of various organizations interfering witheach other.As part of enterprise onboarding, you can separate configurable resources such astemplates, user exits, and so on, based on an enterprise. You can also add newenterprises without impacting the existing enterprise resources. The resourcesconfigured at the enterprise level are identified using a unique Resource Identifier,which can be used to locate the resources belonging to the correspondingenterprise.Enterprise InheritanceAs part of the enterprise onboarding feature, the provides an enterprise with thecapability to inherit the configuration from some other enterprise, for example,enterprise B can choose to inherit the configuration from an existing enterprise A,instead of defining an entirely new set of configurations.For more information about enterprise inheritance, see the section DeterminingInheritance in the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Application PlatformConfiguration Guide.Packaging ExtensionsIn a multi-enterprise setup, managing various levels of extensions andconfigurations can be cumbersome. For example, as part of enterprise onboarding,if you want to expose an additional attribute, you must modify the defaulttemplate to include the additional attribute. This could have an impact on theother on-boarded enterprises. To resolve this complexity, the provides the ability todevelop and package enterprise-specific resources such as database extensions,templates, UI resources, and so on as an extensions service package. This packagecontains all the components to on board an enterprise.For more information about developing and packaging enterprise-level resources,see the section Building and Deploying Enterprise-Level Extensions in the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Customization Basics.Multitenant and Multischema ArchitectureThe multitenant architecture of Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides the ability to support multiple enterprises (tenants) on a singledeployment of the application and to segregate data and configurationsaccordingly. This allows you to leverage your investments in application serversand hardware.A multitenant deployment consists of multiple enterprises that have uniquebusiness needs, such as different process flows, enterprise specific extensions, andrules. In multitenancy, data is partitioned into Transaction and Configurationschemas so that each customer works with a customized virtual applicationinstance.A multischema deployments is a type of multitenant deployment that has multipletransactional database schemas.Multischema deployments comprise the following schemas:Configuration - Stores system and business rules, as well as organizations.Transaction - Stores data transactions related to orders, shipment tasks,inventory.Master Data - Residing along with the Transaction schema, contains data createdthrough batch feeds, such as items and customers.Metadata - Contains data required for database lookup of configurationinformation.Statistics - Maintains statistics for the application, such as agent and APIstatistics.In multischema deployments, one enterprise can be upgraded at a time, whileothers remain on the same version until ready to upgrade.You can enable multischema mode when installing Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation, or install in single-schema mode and enable multischema mode later.If you are upgrading to Release 9.1, you can enable multischema mode afterupgrade, since upgrades can be done only in single-schema mode.For more information about multitenant and multischema deployment options,benefits, and limitations, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Multi-Tenant Enterprise Guide. This guide also explains multischema concepts indepth and how to enable multischema mode.Customer and Vendor DefinitionsAny business group can be represented in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation as an organization with all its subsidiaries defined in a hierarchicalfashion. Any participant viewing this structure would see it in the same consistentway.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation models customers and vendors as arelationship between two participants. In this relationship, organization X can haveits own distinct identifier (Organization ID) for organization Y when it modelsorganization Y as its customer and another identifier when it models organizationY as its vendor. This becomes especially true when multiple Enterprise ResourcePlanning (ERP) systems are involved with each one creating it's own identifier.Even though Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides strongrationalization capabilities to model a participant as a single organization playingmultiple roles, they recognize that most other supply chain systems do not yethave such strong capabilities.Customer and Customer Contact DefinitionWhen defining customers, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation ensures thatthe customers be modeled as organizations. Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation provides the flexibility to use the same organization identifier as thecustomer identifier OR to generate or input a different identification code. Acustomer creation API is enabled to automatically create the organization when acustomer is created.The default billing address, shipping address, sold to address, and paymentmethod are automatically picked up by the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation order entry function or order creation API. This provides you with thecapability of modeling the ERP in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation andthe continued ability to rationalize organizations across ERP systems into onecommon organization to allow better customer service and decision support.A rule can be set to determine whether the default addresses and payment methodin an order are pulled from the customer or the customer's parent in the customerhierarchy. Also, the addresses and payment method on the order can be defaultedfrom a specific customer contact if valid customer contact information is passed aspart of the order entry. A customer contact is an individual consumer in a B2Crelationship or an individual contact within a customer enterprise in a B2Brelationship.Any Enterprise can create Customer entities as needed. Customer roles arespecified as follows:Business - for business to business (B2B) transactions. Business customers arerepresented as follows: Buyer Organization - represents ""Bill To"" information Receiving Node - represents ""Ship To"" informationConsumer - for business to consumer (B2C) transactions. Consumer customersare represented by ""Bill To"" information.Customer statuses indicate whether a customer (and this customer's contacts) canlog in and place orders:Active - Customer and this customer's contacts can log in and place orders.Inactive - Customer and this customer's contacts will not be able to log in. Also,a customer will be unable to create new carts or place orders from existing carts.On Hold - Customer, customer contact, and this customer's orders will go onhold during order confirmation. The type of hold is configurable.For the purpose of product and pricing entitlement, customers can be furtherdefined by the following attributes:Vertical - indicates which industry a customer belongs to, such as Education,Government, and so forth.Relationship Type - indicates whether a customer is a Reseller, a Distributor, aContract Manufacturer, and so forth.Customer Level - indicates tiered values representing a customer's status, suchas Gold, Platinum, Silver, and so forth.Vendor DefinitionSimilar to customer definition, an Enterprise can define its vendor. When definingvendors, a reference must be made to the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation organization but vendor identifier can be different from the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation organization identifier.A vendor can be a Seller Organization, Shipping Node, or both. A vendor isrepresented by ""Ship From"" information.Customer Modeling in a Traditional ERP SystemIn a traditional ERP system where a shoe manufacturing company manufacturestwo major brand named shoes, each shoe line is set up as a separate company(SeeWok and Mockport). Both these companies have a common customer; a majorretailer called M-T-Pockets. Since these shoe lines are modeled as two differentcompanies in the ERP system, the same customer is modeled twice without havingany link to each other. In this model, all customer compliance rules (routing,labeling, payment terms, etc.) must also be defined twice for the major retailer;M-T-Pockets. Figure 6 illustrates this scenario.Customer Modeling in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundationSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides two options for customermodeling in which the customer is set up as two separate customers with differentCustomer IDs or as two separate customers with the same Customer ID. In either case, the customer records for both customers are linked to the same organizationrecord. Figure 7 and Figure 8 on page 30 illustrate these two options.With this option, all customer compliance rules (routing, labeling, payment terms,etc.) defined for the major retailer must be defined only ONCE in this model forthe organization ""M-T-Pockets"". Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationautomatically picks up the right configuration even though they are modeled astwo different customers.Another advantage of this approach is that this rationalization to a singleorganization can be done over a period of time. In the beginning, the customerscould have been represented as two different organizations but over the period oftime when rationalization was feasible, merged into a single entity.With this option, all customer compliance rules (routing, labeling, payment termsetc.) defined for major retailer must be defined only ONCE in this model for theorganization ""M-T-Pockets"". The system automatically picks up the rightconfiguration even though they are modeled as two different customers.Customer ManagementIn most business-to-business environments there are numerous buyers that createcarts, place orders, request quotes, and so forth. Likewise, there are multiplecustomer service representatives (CSRs) who manage the needs of these customersand the orders that they place. However, all customer service representatives donot typically manage all customers within an organization. Each customer servicerepresentative is usually responsible for managing the needs of a select number ofcustomers. Customers can be grouped by a classification or by specific orderattributes.In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, each customer servicerepresentative, or user, can be manually assigned to manage a specific customer orautomatically assigned as a member of a team that is assigned to manage multiplecustomers. Supervisors have access to all customers who are managed by theirteams, or the teams of their descendants.Customer service representatives are user contacts who manage customer accountsfor seller organizations. However, buyer users are user contacts who manageaccounts for customer organizations. Buyer customer assignments allow you toassign a buyer user to one or more customer organizations. Using buyer customerassignments, customers can place their own orders with sellers, and in some cases,place orders on behalf of other customers.Customer assignments are supported in a customer hierarchy with one or moreCustomer Master Organizations.To implement this functionality, you must call theupdateCustomerAssignmentLookup API, either manually or through a service,whenever changes to customer hierarchy or customer assignments occur.Customer Assignments: Customer service representatives (users) are assigned tocustomers:ManuallyManually, based on Order attributesAs a teamIn buyer customer assignments, buyer users are assigned to a customer or a set ofcustomers.Manual Customer AssignmentWhenever a sales person makes the first sale to a customer, he or she can beassigned to manage that customer. In this scenario, manual assignments for eachuser are required so that even though two sales people belong to the same team,one cannot manage customers for the other. Whenever manual user assignmentsare enabled, the user must be directly assigned to the specific customer. Only thendoes that user have access to the customer orders and information. If a user is asupervisor, then he or she has access to orders and information for all customersthat are assigned to his teams and for all customers assigned to their sub-teams.You can define the maximum number of teams or users who can manage thecustomer and the maximum number of customers that can be assigned to aparticular user. Figure 9 on page 32 illustrates customer ownership scenarios formanual customer assignments.Manual Customer Assignment Based on Order AttributesSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides a team code attribute onorders. Users who belong to that team have visibility to those orders. Externallogic should be implemented to populate the team code during order creation andmodification.Customer Assignments to a TeamOften in business-to-business environments, each customer is managed by aspecific team of customer service representatives (users). Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation offers three customer-to-team assignment choices:All users on a team can access all customers assigned to their team.This enables all team members to see orders and receive alerts associated withthe customers who are assigned to the team. To configure this, specify thatmanual user-to-customer assignment is not required.All users on a team require direct assignment to customers.This enables team members to access customer orders and alerts only if theyhave been directly assigned to that customer. To configure this, manualuser-to-customer assignment is required.Some teams can access all customers, while other teams require members to beassigned directly to a customer.Teams that can access all customers see all of their orders and associated alerts.Teams that require direct assignment to customers need access to see acustomer's orders and associated alerts. In this case, manual user-to-customerassignment is required.Team supervisors can access all orders and information for all customers that areassigned to their teams or sub-teams. Whenever a user can access a customer, he orshe can access all of the descendants for this customer.Buyer Customer AssignmentsIn a business-to-business environment, multiple organizations can be modeled ascustomers. Customer contacts, also known as buyer users, can be assigned tomanage accounts for these customers. Buyer customer assignments allowcustomers to manage their own accounts, and in some cases, manage the accountsof other customers. Some customers, however, do not manage their own accountsor other customer accounts.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses organization and user informationpassed through the manageCustomerAssignment API to determine buyer customerassignments. After configuring customer-buyer assignments, data access policiesfor buyer users provide the following choices for account management:Buyer users can access data for their assigned customers only.Buyer users can access data for their assigned customers and child customers.Figure 11 on page 34 illustrates buyer customer assignments in which somecustomers manage accounts for other customers.Multiple Customer Master Organizations: Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation supports customer assignments across multiple customer masterorganizations, where users are assigned to customers from one or more customermaster organizations. In this business scenario, a customer service representative ora buyer user can be assigned to customers that are not part of the same customerhierarchy.When assigning a customer service representative to customers from multiplecustomer master organizations, define a team for the customer servicerepresentative and then add the customer master organizations to the team'senterprise list. Next, the manageCustomerAssignment API is used to assign thecustomer service representative and team to customers. The customer servicerepresentative can manage orders for all the assigned customers.When assigning a buyer user to customers from multiple customer masterorganizations, ensure that the customers belong to the same buyer organization.Next, the manageCustomerAssignment API is used to assign the buyer user tocustomers. The buyer user can manage orders for all the assigned customers.For more information about configuring users and teams, refer to Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.Figure 12 on page 35 illustrates customer assignments for multiple customer masterorganizations.The example shown in Figure 12 demonstrates an account ownership scenario forusers assigned to customers from multiple customer master organizations.To assign CSR 1 and CSR 3 to customers from multiple customer masterorganizations, CSR 1 and CSR 3 are assigned to Team 1, and then the ABC-Retailand ABC-Store customer master organizations are added to Team 1's enterprise list.In this example, CSR 1 and CSR 3 can manage orders for ABC-Retail's customer,Region-01, and ABC-Store's customer, Region-03. Similarly, CSR 2 is assigned toTeam 2, which has the ABC-Online customer master organization added to itsenterprise list. CSR 2 can manage ABC-Online's customer, Region-02. Thesupervisor, Mgr. 1, can manage the orders of all customers assigned to CSR 1, CSR2, and CSR 3.Additionally, in the example, User 3 is assigned to customers from multiplecustomer master organizations. User 3 is assigned to the Region-01 customer fromthe ABC-Retail customer master organization and to the Region-02 customer fromthe ABC-Online customer master organization. Both the Region-01 customer andthe Region-02 customer belong to the same buyer organization, Buyer Organization(XYZ)."
Guidelines for Organization Modeling,"When preparing to set up your organization hierarchical model for Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation, you need to identify which roles and responsibilitiesyou want to define for each organization.To determine which organizations should have which roles and responsibilitiesassigned to them:1. Identify each of the Organizations for your organization hierarchy. That is,business group, companies, legal entities, sales organizations and purchasingorganizations.There can be several reasons for a business group to have multiple companies.One example is the acquisition of a company. Another example could be whenthe business group has two unrelated businesses.A company may need to have multiple legal entities if it operates ingeographical areas that are different from each other in regards to legal issuessuch as currency, taxation structure, or other legal requirements.Decide the basis for defining sales organizations (for example, sales channel,product group, geography or customer). Sales organizations have sourcing rulesand pricing rules. This may help you determine sales organizations. Forexample, if you have different pricing rules or sourcing rules for different saleschannels or geographies, then your sales organizations can be based on saleschannel and geography.2. Identify Enterprises for the organizations in your organization hierarchy.Considerations for identifying Enterprises are explained through the examplesin “Model Example 1: Electronics Company” on page 37 and “Model Example2: Third-Party Logistics Company” on page 40.3. Identify Catalog organization(s). Any organization in the organization hierarchycan be the catalog organization. Typically, the main company is the catalogorganization. The Catalog organization needs to be defined at a lower level inthe organization hierarchy if two organizations of the company have same itemidentifier for two different physical items and the company does not have acommon Item ID for the two items. The Catalog organization can be defined ata lower level if two legal entities do not cross sell each other's items. But, theCatalog organization cannot be below the Inventory organization in thehierarchical structure.4. Identify Inventory organization(s). Any organization in the organizationhierarchy can be an inventory organization. Typically, an inventory organizationis kept at the legal entity level. There are both advantages and disadvantages inkeeping the Inventory organization at this level in the hierarchy. For example, ifthe Inventory organization is at the legal entity level then all salesorganizations of the legal entity have equal access to the inventory in thelocations of the legal entity (with the capabilities to restrict access of a salesorganization to only designated physical locations within the inventoryorganization). This can be an advantage in one business and can bedisadvantage in other business.5. Identify physical location owners (nodes). This definition in most cases shouldmap the real ownership of physical locations. Typically legal entities are ownersof the physical asset and are modeled as owner organizations of nodes."
Installation Level Rules for Organization Modeling,"Installation-level rules are used to automatically default various organizationalroles for a participant.Since organization modeling can be complex to understand, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation provides powerful defaulting rules that can be set up at theinstallation level.When modeling catalog organizations, you can specify if the item master:Is kept at the Hub levelYou specify this if there is just one definition of the item master for the completeinstallation. If you choose this as the default model, all participants areautomatically assigned the Hub organization as their catalog organization at thetime that the participant is created. Using an advanced setup, this default can bechanged as required.Is kept at an Enterprise levelYou specify this if you want all participants defined as Enterprises to becometheir own Catalog organizations. For all other participants, the catalogorganization is designated as their ""primary enterprise"".Is to be defined by every participantWhen modeling inventory or capacity organizations, you can specify if:A single consolidated inventory or capacity view is required for the completeinstallation. If you choose this as the default model, all participants areautomatically assigned the Hub organization as their inventory or capacityorganization at the time that the participant is created. Using an advanced setup,this default can be changed as required.The Inventory or Capacity organization needs to be kept at an Enterprise level.If you choose this as the default model, all participants defined as Enterprisesbecome their own Inventory or Capacity organizations. For all other participants,the inventory or capacity organization is designated as their ""primaryenterprise"".You can change the defaulted value of these organizations to any otherorganization as required using the advanced organization modeling setup.However, it is strongly recommended that you understand the implications oforganization modeling before using the advanced setup provided. There areadvantages and disadvantages in each approach and a good understanding of thisdocument can help you make the right decision.Model Example 1: Electronics CompanyAlphabet Electronics Corporation has two companies, ABC and XYZ.ABC has one legal entity in North America and one in the Asia Pacific. ABC hastwo sales organizations; one sells electronic gadgets (called, Sales-Electronics) andother sells music and movies (called, Sales-Entertainment).ABC North America Sales-Electronics has one distribution center in California andone in Massachusetts.ABC North America Sales-Entertainment has two distribution centers in California,one for music and the other for movies. It also has one distribution center inMassachusetts for both music and movies.ABC North America has one purchasing organization for its distribution centers inNorth America.ABC Asia Pacific has one sales organization for both electronics and entertainment.It has one distribution center in China. It has one purchasing organization for thedistribution centers in Asia Pacific.The organization structure of the XYZ company is the same as ABC.Organization Hierarchy for an Electronics CompanyThe organization hierarchy for the Alphabet Electronics Corporation is illustratedin Figure 13. For simplicity, this illustration shows the organization hierarchy forthe ABC company entity only. The organization hierarchy for the XYZ company isthe same as ABC.Choosing the Enterprise for an Electronics CompanyThe decision about the hierarchy level at which you should have Enterprisesdefined depends on the following:Who defines the business rules and process definition?The ""Enterprise"" owns and controls the document flow and business rulesassociated with the document flow. If the sales organization needs the ability todefine their own process definition and business rules then your Enterpriseneeds to be at the sales organization level.Where does the customer service organization fit in the organization structure?An order can be accessed only by an organization defined as an Enterprise,Buyer, or Seller organization on an order. If customer service is managedcentrally across sales organizations, you may want to create the ""Enterprise"" atthe same level as your customer service organization.Typically Enterprises should be modeled as high as possible in the organizationstructure. This ensures common business practices between different groups. Notethat even though Enterprise responsibility is designated at a higher level, processdefinition can still be differentiated for each of the sales organizations byeffectively using pipeline determination rules.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation supports the definition of multipleorganizations in a single hierarchy to be designated as ""Enterprises"". This enablesyou to model the real organization structure in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation and still get the capability of managing all processes at the lowestlevels in your organization hierarchy.Choosing the Inventory Organization for an Electronics CompanyThe decision about the hierarchy level at which you should have your inventoryorganizations defined depends on the following:Can inventory ownership be established by virtue of physical locations?Your inventory organization provides a clean segregation of inventory betweentwo inventory organizations. If physical locations can establish the legalownership of your inventory, this feature may not be necessary to establish thatownership. If you can afford that luxury then your inventory organization canbe defined up higher in the organization hierarchy allowing better andexpanded inventory views across multiple organizations.Does an organization need the ability to be able to source its sales order fromanother organization?Currently, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation does not allow orderpromising and scheduling for the sales orders of one selling organization fromany other inventory organization but its own (except when inventory ismaintained externally). If organizations belonging to two different legal entitiesmust be able to source from each other, then they must share a commoninventory organization.This situation can also arise when vendors publish inventory information toorganizations. A common inventory organization is designated for all vendorsand the organization needing access to vendor inventory. This allowsorganizations to have visibility to their vendor's inventory also.Note that even though an organization can have only one inventoryorganization, all supply update transactions in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation provides the capability to specify the ""Inventory organization"" forwhich the transaction is being carried out. This provides a powerful featurewhere a vendor can publish their inventory information to multiple inventoryorganizations at the same time. If the inventory is published into two differentinventory organizations for the same product, the vendor must ensure that theyhave logically segmented their inventory to avoid over allocations.Should I model the sales organizations or the legal entities as inventoryorganizations?Inventory organizations can be modeled at the legal entity level without muchconcern if: Your sales organizations are involved in selling of completely differentproducts The same product is sold by multiple sales organizations but each salesorganization has complete ownership of a physical location and thusinventory. Note that access still needs to be controlled through distributiongroups to prevent one sales organization from accessing another salesorganization's physical location.If the same physical location is shared by multiple sales organizationsinvolved in selling the same product and you need clear separation ofinventory for each sales organization then the inventory organization must bemodeled as each sales organization. In the future, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation may provide enhanced segmentation capabilities tohandle such situations.It is strongly suggested that you keep inventory organizations at the legalentity level, as this greatly enhances the inventory visibility acrossorganizations.Should I model legal entities or the company as inventory organizations?Keeping inventory organizations at the company level gives visibility on thecompany's inventory to all organizations in the company. But to be able to doso, the following criteria should be evaluated. Can inventory in each physical location be tied to a legal entity? If yes, thaninventory ownership does not cause problems and does not provide aroadblock. If no, can Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation be obliviousto inventory ownership? In some cases this may not be necessary as SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation may be used as a pure fulfillment solutionwith inventory ownership data being maintained in another system. Can a common catalog organization be established between legal entities toensure that the same item identifiers do not represent two physical products?A common catalog organization serves the function of providing the ""globalitem id"" even when two legal entities may name the same physical itemdifferently and in some cases, two separate physical products the same.If the above questions are answered affirmatively, the company can be modeled asthe inventory organization.Typically, the inventory organization should be modeled at the highest levelpossible to provide the most visibility across organizations.Choosing the Catalog Organization for an Electronics CompanyThe decision about the hierarchy level at which you should have your catalogorganizations defined depends on the following:The catalog organization needs to be at the same level as the inventoryorganization or above.As with other setups, setting up the catalog organization at a higher level causeslesser setup and facilitates the sharing of common definitions.When making this decision determine whether or not item identifiers can berationalized to have unique global identifiers within the business group or somelevel below it. Since item identifiers are unique for a catalog organization, this isa mandatory requirement for being able to push this definition to a higher level.Model Example 2: Third-Party Logistics Company3PL is a third party logistics company. 3PL's clients are ABC and XYZ.3PL stores inventory for ABC and XYZ in its warehouses and fulfills orders forABC and XYZ. The businesses of ABC and XYZ are very similar and they can havethe same item identifiers representing two different physical items.3PL's revenue comes from the service fee for processing its clients' sales orders andpurchase orders. 3PL sends the order processing details to its financial organizationto collect the service fees from the clients.The inventory in 3PL's warehouses is owned by the clients. 3PL has one warehousein California and one in Massachusetts. 3PL stores products owned by both theclients (ABC and XYZ) in the same warehouse.The organization structure of ABC and XYZ is the same as what is described in theprevious example with the following differences:They have operations only in North America.They do not own a distribution center (sourcing location). Their inventory iskept in 3PL's locations.The two sales organizations of ABC, Electronics and Entertainment, do not wantto have visibility on each other's inventory. However, this is not the case withXYZ.Each client generates purchase orders to replenish its stock in 3PL's warehouses.The client sends the purchase order to its vendor. It also sends a copy of the samepurchase order to 3PL so that 3PL can receive the product.Orders are managed by 3PL but the clients (ABC and XYZ) need visibility of theirorders. The clients also need to have certain order modification permissions butnot all. Warehouse operators also need visibility to orders and the ability to receivereturns.Organization Hierarchy for a Third-Party Logistics CompanyOne possible organization hierarchy for the 3PL Company is illustrated inFigure 14 on page 42.Choosing the Enterprise for a Third-Party Logistics CompanyAs described in the previous example, this depends at what level you want tocontrol the business rule definition, order fulfillment process definition and userprivileges.3PL defines and maintains business rules and order fulfillment processes for ordersof its clients. So, defining only 3PL as the Enterprise can be the desirable option.But, ABC and XYZ need visibility and certain order modification permissions ontheir orders. Also, ABC and XYZ may want to create and maintain their users. Thismeans, ABC and XYZ also need certain enterprise-level capabilities. So, defining3PL, ABC, and XYZ all as enterprises is the more appropriate option. But with thisoption, 3PL needs to restrict permissions for ABC and XYZ so that they do nothave the ability to define and maintain order fulfillment processes.If ABC or XYZ does not want certain users (for example, customer servicerepresentatives) of its one sales organization to have the visibility of orders of itsother sales organization, then each sales organization can also be assigned theEnterprise role with restricted privileges.Choosing the Inventory Organization for a Third-Party LogisticsCompanyAs discussed in the previous example, the inventory organizations in this modelcan be ABC, XYZ Sales-Electronics and XYZ Sales-Entertainment. This is becauseXYZ does not want its sales organization to see inventory of the other salesorganization.In situations such as third-party logistics where the same physical location isshared across multiple clients, each client should be designated as the ""Inventoryorganization"". If 3PL is dealing with multiple organizations of the same client, itcan make choices of inventory organizations based on segregation level mandatedby the client or client organizations.Choosing the Catalog Organization for a Third-Party LogisticsCompanyThe catalog organization can be defined at the same level as the inventoryorganization or above. Since, the two sales organizations of XYZ do not have sameitem identifiers for two different items, the catalog organizations can be ABC andXYZ."
Process Modeling Concepts,"Process modeling in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation enables you to setup your business workflow of orders, inventory changes, returns, paymentauthorizations, or many other system events.A typical business process model consists of:Base Document Types and Document TypesProcess Type PipelinesRepositoriesTransactionsConditionsActionsServicesProcess Modeling Tasks"
Base Document Types and Document Types,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses base document types anddocument types to carry information through a configured workflow process. Abase document type defines the business documents that Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation handles and defines a common storage structure for allderived document types.The following base document types are defined in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation:OrderLoadGeneralCountContainerOutbound PickingWork OrderOpportunityDocument types are specific business documents that are derived from a basedocument type. For example, document types such as Sales Order and PurchaseOrder can be derived from the Order base document type.The following document types are defined in Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation:Planned OrderSales OrderPurchase OrderReturnTemplate OrderTransfer OrderMaster OrderLoadGeneralCountContainerOutbound PickingWork OrderQuoteBusiness rules such as payment collection rules and modification rules must be setup for each document type. For more information about setting up business rulesfor document types, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: ApplicationPlatform Configuration Guide."
Process Type Pipelines,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, a business document, such as anOrder, goes through a series of defined processes. These processes are called baseprocess types. Every type of base document has a defined set of base process types.For example, the Order base document type has the following base process typesdefined for it:FulfillmentNegotiationDeliveryThe Load base document type has the Load base process type defined for it.The General base document type has the General base process type defined for it.You configure the flow of these processes in the Process Modeling by creatingprocess type pipelines. A process type pipeline is a series of transactions andstatuses that guide document types, such as Sales Order and Purchase Order,through a related process. A pipeline consists of the different statuses a documentgoes through during fulfillment. You can also set up transactions consisting ofevents, actions, and conditions, as they pertain to the pipeline you are configuring.The following tables detail each base process type, the process types that arederived from them, and the pipelines associated with the process type.Pipeline DeterminationPipeline determination is used to set up conditions that affect which pipeline isused during the workflow. For example, an organization deals with sales ordersthat sometimes contain hazardous materials. They have two separate pipelines, onein which orders with order lines without any hazardous materials go through thenormal order process and one in which orders with order lines containinghazardous materials must go through inspection before continuing through theorder process. The organization uses pipeline determination to set up a conditionthat determines whether or not order lines contain hazardous materials and sendsthe order down the correct pipeline."
Repositories,"A repository is a logical collection of entities that define a given business process.The following entities are included in a repository:PipelinesTransactionsStatusesConditionsActionsServicesSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides a repository for each of theprocess types. When creating a new process type from a base process type, thecorresponding base repository entities are copied and attached to the new processtype. For example, when a Sales Order Fulfillment process type is created from theFulfillment base process type, the base repository entities contained in Fulfillmentare copied and attached to Sales Order Fulfillment."
Transactions,"Every base process type has a set of base transactions defined for it. A transaction isa logical unit of work that is necessary for performing activity within SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation. Base transactions are predefined transactionsthat contain information about how the transaction behaves, such as how manycopies of a transaction can be kept in a process type and whether or not it canhave configurable base pick and drop statuses. Base transactions can be used tocreate new transactions. These transactions can be changed within the limitsdefined in the base transaction.In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, APIs are used to completetransactions. When an API is invoked, the Transaction ID is determined based onthe context that the API was completed. The transaction ID identifies thetransaction to be completed. Depending on the situation, the transaction ID can bepassed as an input parameter or it can be pre-defined for the invoking API. Formore information about APIs, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Javadocs.Transactions can be classified as one or more of the following types:Externally-triggeredUser-triggeredTime-triggeredExternally-Triggered TransactionsAn externally-triggered transaction is performed through the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation Services Definition Framework which calls a correspondingAPI within Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation to complete the transaction.User-Triggered TransactionsA user-triggered transaction is performed based on user actions performed in theSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation User Interface, configured alert queue,or an e-mail exchange.Time-Triggered TransactionsA time-triggered transaction is performed on scheduled intervals. In Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation, a time-triggered transaction is also called an agent.Transaction DependencyIn the order fulfillment cycle, you can have specific products and services in anorder that need to be fulfilled in a particular sequence. You can set updependencies on a transaction such that an order line cannot be processed untilcertain conditions are met. The dependencies enable you to define rules based onitem classifications, item IDs, service types, and many other conditions that can bedefined for on an order line.Transaction Dependencies can be configured at a specific enterprise, documenttype, and process type level. For example, a dependency specified by an enterprisefor a schedule transaction applies to all the sales orders of that enterprise,regardless of the pipeline used.Before processing, each order line is checked for any dependencies on thetransaction. If multiple dependencies are defined for a transaction, all thedependencies have to be satisfied before the line can be processed.Dependencies can also be defined for bundle components and based on any orderdate. In the case of the bundle components, the order lines may haveinterdependencies while fulfilling a bundle order. The bundle parent line cannot beinvoiced until every child line has completed the specified transaction. Therefore, itis necessary to allow for transactions to understand that an order line cannot beprocessed until certain conditions are met. For more information about bundlecomponents, see “Bundles” on page 113.The order date related dependency can be configured for a transaction based onspecific order dates. You can specify these dependencies using templates providedwith Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. For more information aboutconfiguring this dependency, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Application Platform Configuration Guide.Transaction Dependency Usage ScenarioThe transaction dependency for an order can be used in the following scenario:For any order line with item classifications of MODEM, FILTER, or CABLE, theschedule transaction is not allowed to process until 24 hours after all the orderlines containing items with the classification of LINE ACTIVATION havecompleted the ship order transaction.If this dependency is specified, the schedule transaction first checks to see if thereis an item with the MODEM classification in the order. If the item is identified,other lines on the order are checked to see if any of them have a LINEACTIVATION class item. For each line with an item classification of LINEACTIVATION, it is then determined if it has been at least 24 hours since that linereached the “SHIP_ORDER” transaction.Transaction Dependency Halting Other TransactionsWhen a transaction dependency halts an order-level transaction, such as paymentprocessing, a flag is returned in the output XML of the API to indicate that theorder cannot be processed due to dependencies. The flag is not returned in theoutput XML of all APIs. For more information, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Javadocs. Since most transactions are status-based, theyignore any lines that have not met the dependencies. However, when an agentencounters an order that cannot be processed, either in whole or in part due to adependency, it silently ignores whatever lines cannot be processed and updates thetask queue to process them at a later time.Overriding DependenciesTo override transaction dependencies, you can pass a flag to the API that invokesthe transaction so that the transaction dependencies are ignored. This flag is onlysupported by some APIs. For more information about APIs, see the Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs.Circular DependenciesCircular dependencies arise when a transaction is dependent on anothertransaction that is waiting for the main transaction to either change its status orcomplete. You can set up dependencies in such a way that a transaction may neverprocess an order due to a circular dependency.For example, there may be a rule that says ITEM1 cannot be scheduled untilITEM2 has completed the schedule transaction. There could be another rule thatprevents ITEM2 from scheduling until ITEM1 has scheduled. As a result, a circulardependency arises. In this case, the circular dependency is detected by thetransaction dependency logic and an exception is thrown along with a list of thedependencies that caused this circular loop.Supported TransactionsThe system transactions that support dependencies are identified by a flag in itsbase process type.This flag cannot be edited for system or built-in transactions. You can enable ordisable the dependencies only for extended or custom transactions. Keep in mind,that system and custom listeners do not support transaction dependency. However,you can configure transaction completion for each instance of the listener. For moreinformation about configuring transaction completion, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.The supported transactions are:Chained Order Create - This transaction ignores the order lines that do not meetthe dependencies.Close Order - This agent ignores the order if any of the order lines do not meetthe dependencies.Payment Collection - This API returns a flag to indicate that the dependenciesare preventing the transaction from processing if any line has unmetdependencies. However, the agent ignores the current order and processes it inthe next run.Payment Execution - This API returns a flag to indicate that dependencies arepreventing the transaction from processing if any line has unmet dependencies.However, the agent ignores the current order and processes it in the next run.RELEASE - This transaction ignores the lines that do not meet the criteria andpopulates the schedule failure reason for any line that was not processed due tothe dependencies.SCHEDULE - This transaction ignores the lines that do not meet the criteria, andpopulates the schedule failure reason for any line that was not processed due tothe dependencies.Abstract transactions have a different flag to indicate the type of dependencysupported.The two types of dependencies that are supported by abstract transactions are:None - The support dependency for an individual instance of the transaction isalways N.Instance Specific - The support dependency is configurable for each instance ofthe transaction.By default, all abstract transactions have this dependency flag set to None.However, the following abstract transactions support specific instances such thatthey ignore any line that does not meet the dependencies:Change Order StatusCreate Order InvoiceDerived Order CreateSend Order.For more information about configuring transaction dependencies, associated rules,and constraints, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Distributed OrderManagement Configuration Guide.Task Queue UpdatesWhen a task queue-based agent is prevented from processing a transaction withdependencies, the date when the order is ready to process is calculated.Upon completing the transaction, the dependencies are examined to see if there areany lines waiting on the completion of this transaction. The task queue dates fordependent transactions are then re-calculated. Additionally, when a change is madeto the order date, ship date, or delivery date, dependencies are re-evaluatedsimilarly.An example usage scenario for the next available date calculation is discussed in""Next Available Date Calculation"".The agents for the transactions are updated to apply transaction dependencies tothe order lines before processing. If the order lines are not processed due todependencies, the agent updates the task queue date.Next Available Date CalculationThe next available date is calculated to identify when the order is ready to beprocessed. The following example provides the method of calculation for the nextavailable date.For example, an order has two order lines. The second order line cannot bescheduled until 24 hours after the first order line has completed the SHIP_ORDERtransaction.Until the SHIP_ORDER transaction on the first order line is completed, the earliestavailable date for scheduling that order line is set to:sysdate + 24h.When the SHIP_ORDER transaction on the first order line completes, the taskqueue date for scheduling the second order line is set to:sysdate + 24h.The next task queue date for the entire order is determined by computing theearliest available date on each of the remaining dependencies. The lower boundaryof each line’s maximum is the date, which is set. For example:Line 1 – dependency 1 - earliest date = sysdate + 5hLine 1 – dependency 2 - earliest date = sysdate + 48hLine 2 – dependency 1 - earliest date = sysdate + 12hThe earliest date for Line 1 is the maximum of (sysdate + 5h) and (sysdate + 48h)or sysdate + 48h. However, for the entire order the minimum across the lines iscalculated as:Line 2’s sysdate + 12h.Finally, if the transaction had pushed the task queue date out, the minimum of thisdate and the task queue date of the transaction is used. For example, if one linecannot be scheduled because of a dependency, and the other line is backordered. Ifthe backorder relog interval is less than the calculated time for the remainingdependencies, the backorder relog interval is used instead.Transaction CompletionThe transactions configured in the pipeline changes the status of the order lineafter successful execution. A transaction is either complete or incomplete for anorder line, based on the status change. All the transactions need not understandthe completion. This is based on the configuration. The completion is recordedonly if that transaction can be configured for completion. Once the transaction isenabled for completion, it is evaluated to be marked as completed or incompletewhenever any status change happens to the order line. In some cases, a completedtransaction can be marked as incomplete since its status could be demoted.There are two ways to mark a transaction as complete or incomplete. One wayprovides a single status and whenever the order line goes past, this statustransaction is marked as complete. The other way to mark a transaction ascomplete is by providing a list of statuses. If the order line is in any of thosestatuses, the transaction is marked as complete. To avoid configuring a list ofstatuses, it is better to configure statuses in an ascending order as the order's lifecycle progresses.For example, if transaction X needs to be completed before transaction Y, thentransaction X should drop in status which is less than the status transaction Ydrops in to.The order fulfillment pipeline has transactions pre-configured for completion. Youcannot modify the completion criteria for system transactions. However, you canconfigure the completion for custom or derived transactions. You can alsoconfigure completion for derived listeners, but it has to be done for every instanceof the listener.An event is triggered when a transaction is completed and it is determined that theorder is ready to process the dependent transaction. This event also allows thecustom transactions to know that the order is ready for processing.There can be multiple transactions that become ready due to one transactioncompletion. The event is raised for each transaction on the order line that werewaiting for the completion of this order line.For more information about transaction completion configuration and the raisedevent, see the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Application PlatformConfiguration Guide.EventsAn event is a specific occurrence in the business process; often a status change orgenerated alert. Releasing an order and cancelling an order are both examples ofevents. When an event occurs in a transaction an action is triggered.StatusesStatuses are the actual states that a document changes to and from as it movesthrough the pipeline. A transaction can contain two types of statuses, a drop statusand a pickup status. A document is moved into a drop status when a transactionand its events have been completed. A pickup status takes the document from thedrop status and moves it through the next transaction. ""Created"" and ""Scheduled""are examples of statuses."
Conditions,"A condition matches document type attributes against decision points and routesthe document to the appropriate path based on the specified attribute and valuecombinations. The document type attributes against which conditions can becreated are pre-defined in Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. You can usethese attributes in any combination or you can create conditions that run theappropriate application logic for specific circumstances.For example, at a certain point in a Sales Order Fulfillment process-type pipelineyou set up a condition to determine if an order contains hazardous materials.When an order reaches this condition in the pipeline, it cannot move any further until the condition is met with a definitive Yes or No value. In this example, if theorder contains no hazardous materials, the value is No and the order continuesthrough the regular pipeline. If the order does contain hazardous material, thevalue is Yes and the order is sent down an alternate branch of the order pipelinethat has been configured to deal with hazardous material orders.Advanced XML ConditionsAn advanced XML condition provides for a declarative mechanism to operate onan input XML document and evaluate conditions using the XPath expressions.These advanced XML conditions are also referred to as Greex Rules. The syntax ofthe advanced XML condition is XML based.An advanced XML condition helps you to define XML based conditions or rulesbased on Greex syntax. Some of the most significant features of advanced XMLconditions are:XML awarenessSupport for namespacesSupport for decision tablesA set of built-in libraries.Ability to return an XML element, a String, or Boolean.The advanced XML condition constructs are capable of being either nested byusing multiple IF and ELSE blocks or grouped by using either an AND or an ORoperator. Each expression comprises one or more function calls. These functionscan be nested, meaning parameters to functions can be other function calls.A set of these functions is provided as part of the Greex library. These functionscan be called on input data via XPath expressions. Constants can be used infunction parameters as well. The Greex library is available for use as a jar. Itcontains no dependency on either the existing platform or other components.Therefore, it is to be used as a third party library.The Greex Framework supports the following type of advanced XML conditions orGreex rules:Normal Advanced XML Conditions—In this type of advanced XML condition,you can specify nested condition criteria using multiple IF and ELSE blocks. Anormal advanced XML condition can return an XML element, a String, or aBoolean value.These type of advanced XML conditions are useful in cases where you need todefine multiple condition criteria for an advanced XML condition you need todefine multiple condition criteria and each condition criteria has differentattributes associated with it.For example, you may want to create an advanced XML condition for thefollowing condition criteria:If Ordertype=""WEB"" and OrderQty=""100"", then Discount=""20"".ElseIf OriginalTotalAmout=""1000"" and OrderLine>""5"", thenTaxExemptFlag=""Y"".Else HoldFlag=""True"".In this case, we have multiple condition criteria and each condition criteria hasdifferent attributes associated with it. The first condition criteria has Ordertype,OrderQty, and Discount associated with it whereas the second condition criteriahas OriginalTotalAmount, OrderLine, and TaxExemptFlag associated with it.Decision Table Based Advanced XML Conditions—In this type of advanced XMLcondition, you can specify nested condition criteria in a single advanced XMLcondition. You can have just one advanced XML condition with an array ofconstant values instead of one constant value. Also, in a decision table based advanced XML condition you need only one condition, hence you have only oneIF block and no ELSE block. A decision table based advanced XML conditioncan only return a String.These type of advanced XML conditions are useful for cases in which you havemultiple nested condition criteria to be defined for an advanced XML conditionand each condition criteria has same attributes associated with it. In such cases,you can write just one condition and have a table of parameters that works likea switch statement.For example, you may want to create an advanced XML condition for thecondition criteria, which contains different cases for the same type of attributes.If Ordertype=""WEB"" and OrderLineQty=""200"", then Discount=""5"".ElseIf Ordertype=""STORE"" and OrderLineQty=""500"", then Discount=""7""ElseIf Ordertype=""CALL"" and OrderLineQty=""250"", then Discount=""3"".Elsedefault=""0""In this case, we have multiple condition criteria but each condition criteria hassame attributes associated with it. All the condition cases have Ordertype,OrderLineQty, and Discount attributes associated with it. If none of the conditioncases defined are satisfied, the Greex engine returns the default value.An advanced XML condition or Greex rule can only be created through the IDEtool called the Sterling Greex Editor. An advanced XML condition is defined in theadvanced XML file also known as Greex file. For more information about creatingan advanced XML condition using the Sterling Greex Editor, see the Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation: Extending the Condition Builder.You are not allowed to modify the structure of an existing advanced XMLcondition or Greex rule through the Applications Manager. You can only assignnew values to modifiable parameters of an advanced XML condition. For moreinformation about modifying an advanced XML condition, see the Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.You can localize an advanced XML condition or Greex rule by localizing the Greexfile. The Greex file can be localized by implementing BundleReslover interface. Formore information about localizing Greex file, see the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation: Localization Guide.You can also log information about an advanced XML condition or Greex rule atdifferent levels by implementing GreexLogger interface. For more information about logging information about an advanced XML condition or Greex Rule, seethe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Extending the Condition Builder."
Actions,"An action is a process or program that is triggered by an event. These processesand programs send alert notifications and automatically resolve issues.For example, when an order is released (the event), you can set an action to sendthe customer an e-mail message."
Services,Services define the business process flow between Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation and external systems.

Inventory Identification,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses inventory identification numbersto differentiate products. This is also the case for products that requiredifferentiation both physically and systematically for ""product instances"" that haveslightly different characteristics. Some common examples of such identificationnumbers are lot number, revision number and manufacturing batch number ormanufacturing dates. Different industries may have their own identificationnumbers. For example, some companies dealing with steel identify a roll of steelwith a ""mill certificate number"".These identification numbers are not necessarily relevant to every product acompany sells. For some products a lot number uniquely defines all characteristicsof a product whereas a revision number differentiates another product. SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation uses the term ""Inventory Tag Number"" torationalize these unique product identification situations. In most cases it isexpected that the Inventory Tag Number represents one of the real lifemanufacturing or customization numbers such as lot number, batch number, orrevision number based on the product. With small product extensions, theInventory Tag Number can also represent a combination of identification numbersfor cases where two inventory identification numbers together uniquely identifythe product.In most cases, the Inventory Tag Number is used by the Sterling Global InventoryVisibility and the physical product carries the actual relevant inventoryidentification numbers.Lot Number Used as Inventory Tag NumberThe following figure illustrates a paint product that uses a lot number to identifythe specific blend that was mixed at the same time. In this case, the inventory tagnumber is the same as the lot number.In cases where the Inventory Tag Number is different from the productidentification or is a combination of product identifiers, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation stores both the identifiers for the item.Combination Batch and Revision Tag NumberThe following figure illustrates a product that uses a batch number and revisionnumber combination to uniquely identify the product.In this case, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation stores both the revision #and the batch# for the inventory item. The getTagNo() user exit is provided togenerate the Inventory Tag Number and inquire on it whenever necessary. Thisuser exit can have its own logic of merging the two identifiers or storing thecombination in a separate table and returning an external tag number. Thisexternal tag number can be used as the unique inventory identifier in SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation.The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation stores tag information and has theability to track tag numbers and ship by dates for all shipments. However, if anode does not use the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation software andcannot track tag information, it cannot inform Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation about these details of a product that has shipped. For such nodes, tagtracking is not supported.In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, tag number and ship by date arecompletely unrelated. The assignment of a lot number to an item does not causethe assignment of a ship by date to the item."
Supply and Demand,"In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, the supply for an item is the entirequantity of the item received at a node. Supply includes the on-hand supply. Thesupply consists of purchase orders (POs) and advance shipment notices (ASNs)received by the node. In addition to on-hand supply, supply includes futureinventory—previously placed purchase orders that have not arrived from vendors.In Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, the demand for an item is theexpressed desire to consume a quantity of the item. Demand includes ordersplaced and reservations made for an item.Demand can only be fulfilled if sufficient supply exists. The quantity available isthe amount of supply left over after all demands for the item are fulfilled.Therefore, the available inventory is the difference between its supply and itsdemand.ReservationsIn Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, demand is composed of differenttypes of specific entities called “demands.” One type of demand is a reservation.How do you guarantee a customer that inventory has been put aside for them?One way is to create a reservation on the system, which the customer mustconfirm or cancel. A reservation is a quantity of an item that the seller puts asidefor a customer who has the intent to purchase the items at a later date. This takesan amount of inventory out of available inventory to cater to a customer's specificdemand. A reservation can be upgraded to an order or it can be canceled.For example, you manufacture snow shovels. Your customer, the ABC Hardwarestore, ""reserves"" 150 snow shovels for November 5th. You create an order for 150snow shovels in ""reserved"" status. The ABC Hardware store can either cancel thereservation or have the snow shovels shipped.A reservation can be scheduled to expire by passing a reservation expiration dateor time. The expiration date can be specified in an individual order, or a defaultexpiration time can be configured, after which existing reservations are cancelled.This feature allows you to clean up reservations that may not have been cancelledfor any reason.Note: You cannot reserve inventory that has been segmented. For moreinformation about segmented inventory, see “Segmentation.”NoteSegmentationIn Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation, supply is composed of differenttypes of specific entities. A type of ""supply"" is inventory segmentation. How doyou guarantee a customer that inventory has been put aside for them? Inventorysegmentation is the apportion of inventory into segments. An inventory segment isa certain amount of inventory set aside to cater to the demand from a group ofprivileged customers. This inventory is what is required to fulfill commitments andcontracts. When inventory is apportioned for a segment, it indicates that theinventory is not to be consumed for demands other than the demands withmatching segments segment types, or both.For example, you are a shampoo manufacturer or supplier. You have contractswith a major pharmaceutical chain and a department store chain to supply themeach with one of your brands of shampoo according to their specifications. Whenthey place an order, their demand is recorded with the pre-arranged segment orsegment type. The demand is fulfilled from the supply with the matching segmentor segment type at the node for the shampoo manufacturer or supplier.Note: You cannot reserve inventory that has been segmented. For moreinformation about reserved inventory, see “Reservations” on page 62.NoteInventory Availability MonitoringE-commerce businesses often need real-time inventory availability indicators sothat they can provide to their customers snapshots of the inventory picture withoutconstantly making calls to Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation. This can bevery helpful on web sites where orders are placed, and the inventory is beingviewed and modified all the time. Examples of inventory availability indicators areIn Stock, Low, Limited, and Backorder/Pre-order, and Out of Stock. The criteria foreach indicator level can be defined in the Applications Manager.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides this functionality through thereal-time inventory availability monitor. There are three ways in which it can run:Activity Based ModeIn this mode, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation keeps track of inventorychanges in real time. If the inventory level of a given item goes above or below athreshold defined in the monitoring rule of the Applications Manager, SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation publishes the updated inventory level toexternal systems.Quick Sync ModeWhen running in this mode, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation sends themost recent inventory availability information recorded by the monitor out toexternal systems. If an item's inventory level went from In-Stock to Low and thenback to In-Stock, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation only publishes the'In-Stock' level for that item at synchronization time.Additionally, since inventory availability information includes on-hand and futureavailability, this mode can be used to send availability messages to the planningand promotion systems.Full Sync ModeTypically, an enterprise runs this as a scheduled job, generally at night time.Inventory availability information is sent for all items, regardless of whether or notthey have been through availability changes.The Full Sync mode is expected to be used the first time the inventory availabilitymonitor is run, if inventory information has not been loaded into Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation through the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation APIs or Services.Note: Even when running in activity-based mode, the inventory availabilitymonitor does not completely operate in real-time. Inventory changes need to bepublished to a database table, which needs to be processed by the monitor. Youshould therefore think of it as near real-time."
Optimization,"Inventory optimization occurs when you fine tune the amount of availableinventory according to the orders you expect to receive. The concept of “lead +processing time” helps you to optimize inventory.Consider an item with 20 units available in the warehouse ready for shipping.Suppose an order arrives to ship 20 units of that item 12 days from now.Suppose a different customer asks if you can accept an order for 10 units to shipsix days from now. Should you accept this order? In other words, do you have 10units available to promise (ATP) six days from now?Addressing this question requires the following scheduling parameters:Lead time – The time required to obtain the item from your suppliers ormanufacturers if you were to place a new purchase order today.Inbound processing time – The time required to process a supply after it hasarrived in your node.Outbound processing time – The time required for your node to assemble anitem, perform any value-added services, and physically ship the item.The sum of these three parameters for an item is known as lead + processing time.Within the lead + processing time, you can expect to submit a purchase order toyour supplier, receive the supply into your node, process the item, and ship it out.Therefore, demands with expected fulfillment dates beyond the lead + processingtime can be fulfilled irrespective of your current inventory situation.To return to the example, you can accept the order for 10 units if the lead +processing time allows you to fill both the order for 10 units six days from nowand the order for 20 units 12 days from now."
Fast-Moving Inventory,"In some cases, it may be best not to guarantee inventory availability beyond acertain date even though you currently have sufficient inventory available. If theitem in question is a fast-moving item and you can expect to exhaust all on-handinventory long before an order is to be shipped, you may not want to holdinventory for that future order.A good example of this can be found in the recent launching of a popular toy.Retailers refused to guarantee availability two weeks from the launch date. Theycorrectly assumed that they would exhaust all available and expected inventorylong before orders were due to be shipped."
Life Span of Supply and Demand,"A supply of items is good only while the items are consumable. Some itemsdegrade over time. Examples include pharmaceuticals, food stuffs, beverages, andflowers. The time period during which an item can be kept stocked forconsumption is known as its shelf life. The expiration date marks the end of theshelf life of an item.The time window in which current supply can be used to fulfill demand is referredto as the life span. The date beyond which a supply can no longer be shipped tocustomers because supply has degraded is called the ship-by date. The ship-bydate is always earlier than or equal to the expiration date of the supply.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows users to specify a minimumship-by date during order creation, which takes into consideration the preferredremaining life span of a time-sensitive item at the time of its shipment during thepromising and scheduling processes. For more information about minimumship-by dates, see “Minimum Ship-By Date” on page 140.Demand has a life span too. For example, a customer may order a product todaycontingent on delivery within two weeks from the date of the order. The life spanof the demand is two weeks.One of the most important aspects of inventory management is managing andunderstanding the life span of supplies and demands.A demand is fulfilled if and only if the following are true:The quantity of the supplies is sufficient to fulfill demand.The life span of one or more supplies overlaps the life span of the demand.The life span of Supply 1 does not overlap with the life span of Demand 1.Therefore, the demand remains unfulfilled. Demand 1 cannot be fulfilled becausethere is no available supply to cater to it and a freshly ordered supply does notarrive within the lead + processing time.The life span of Supply 2 overlaps with the life span of its demand. Therefore,Demand 2 can be fulfilled."
Inventory Consolidation,"The Hub organization specifies the rule to determine how inventory items areidentified and consolidated. The Hub can choose to consolidate at either the Hublevel or the Enterprise level. When inventory is consolidated at the Hub level, theitem ID and unit of measure is assumed to be unique across all organizations andthere is no inventory segmentation. Choosing Enterprise level consolidation impliesinventory is segregated by each enterprise. For more information about choosingHub-level or Enterprise-level consolidation, see the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation: Application Platform Configuration Guide.When deciding what level to consolidate inventory at, you must take intoconsideration the following system functions and how they are affected:Drop shipping - You must consider which organizations can be used for dropshipping the sales orders of an organization. Any organization can drop shiptheir sales orders from any other organization that is part of the same inventoryconsolidation.Note: You can drop ship orders to a ship node whose owner belongs to adifferent inventory consolidator if you first ensure all inventory adjustments forthis ship node are created passing the correct organization code to theadjustInventory API.Note: For example, if ShipNode1 is owned by organization code DEFAULT(Inventory Consolidator = DEFAULT), by default if you call adjust Inventory forthis ship node (without passing the organization code), the adjustment is madefor the inventory consolidator of the ship node owner, in this case DEFAULT.Note: If Enterprise1 (Inventory Consolidator = Enterprise1) wishes to sourceinventory from ShipNode1, all inventory adjustments at ShipNode1 forEnterprise1 must be made by passing OrganizationCode=Enterprise1 whencalling the adjustInventory API.Inventory visibility - All organizations that are part of the same inventoryconsolidation have access to inventory of all other organizations with the onlylimitation being their own distribution setup.Inventory monitoring - Inventory and availability monitoring can only be runfor the inventory consolidator.Hub Level ConsolidationHub level consolidation provides the most flexibility in drop shipping orders. Anyorganization can use the shipping node of any other organization to drop shiptheir sales order. Based on the distribution rules setup of the organization, they canlook for item availability across all organizations within the hub.Choosing Hub level consolidation also exposes the inventory of an organization toall of the other organizations in the Hub and allows the inventory monitor,availability monitor, and FEFO rules to be set only at the Hub level.Enterprise Level ConsolidationEnterprise level consolidation provides restricted drop shipping for orders. Anyorganization can use the node of any other organization to drop ship their salesorder as long as they all have the same inventory consolidator. Based on thedistribution rules setup of the organization, they can look for item availabilityacross all organizations with the same primary Enterprise.Since inventory is separated by each Enterprise, an Enterprise has no visibility tothe inventory of the other Enterprises. Inventory can also be monitored for eachEnterprise.Also, though an organization can participate in multiple Enterprises, they mustchoose one Enterprise as their inventory consolidator and is the only Enterprisethey can maintain inventory in."
Synchronizing with Node Inventory,"Inventory changes can occur in warehouses without Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation being immediately aware of it. For example, in the event oflost or damaged goods. Because of this, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationneeds to regularly reconcile its internal inventory picture with the inventorypicture at the nodes. This process is broken down into two steps:1. Loading the inventory picture from a nodeThe inventory picture at the node is downloaded to Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation. That information is stored in temporary table.2. Synchronizing the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation inventory pictureand the actual inventory picture.The data in between the temporary table and the base inventory table iscompared, and if needed, synchronized.Once this process is complete, an agent needs to be configured and run in order toclean up the temporary tables. For more information about configuring the synchronization with node inventory, see the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation: Global Inventory Visibility Configuration Guide."
Synchronizing with Node Demand,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the ability to synchronizedemands from external systems. Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation takesa set of ship nodes, demand types, and demand pictures as input. It then resets thedemand information for the ship nodes and demand types based upon thedemand picture it received as input."
Hot SKU,"A Hot SKU is a popular item with a high volume of requests during a specificperiod of time. For example, the release of a new CD from a very popular artistmight generate a high volume of requests for that item right as it goes on themarket.Under high transaction load, the presence of Hot SKUs can create a situationwhere multiple lock requests are placed on the same item at the same time. Whenthat happens, one transaction holds the lock and the rest are blocked.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation can identify a certain item as a HotSKU automatically. Under normal conditions, when Hot SKUs are not detected, thesystem would place a lock on an item during inventory changes, update thesupply and demand tables, and then release the lock. When an item is consideredhot, the system does not lock it. Instead, the changes are inserted into twoadditional tables, one for demand and one for supply.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation always looks at both the base andadditional tables. In order to keep the additional tables from growing infinitely,Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides an agent that reconciles thebase and additional supply and demand tables.For detailed information regarding the Hot SKU functionality, refer to the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Performance Management Guide."
Count,"Accuracy of inventory level is critical to a supply chain. Inventory levels are thekey to having better customer satisfaction and demand planning.A count system allows you to carry out counts in a planned or in an ad hocmanner. A common type of count employed is year-end inventories. While this isexhaustive, it is also time consuming, and does not ensure accuracy throughout theyear. The other method is to only count items based on velocity or price everyquarter. However, the best method is to ensure count performed periodically in thesystem.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows enterprises to define countprograms by item category and define the number of times a category of itemneeds be counted in a specific period at a specific node, nodes in a region, or allparticipating nodes.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows enterprises to initiate countrequests through console on an ad hoc basis for a specific node, all nodes in aspecific region, or all participating nodes.Examples of count requests that can be created by an enterprise include:1. Request to count an item, product class, and UOM combination2. Request to count an item category3. Request to count items that have unit price in a specific rangeCounts for count requests created in an ad hoc or planned fashion are performedat participating nodes. The resolution of variances found, if any, ensure inventorycorrectness at that node. The Enterprise initiating a request is kept informed whenall the nodes that have been requested to count, have finished counting.For more details on count execution at a node, see the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation: Warehouse Management System Concepts Guide."
Inventory Consignment,"Inventory Consignment is a concept in which inventory availability of oneinventory organization can be accounted as part of inventory availability ofanother inventory organization.The inventory organizations participating in theinventory consignment program are called consumable inventory organizationsand consuming inventory organizations.A consuming inventory organization can choose a list of consumable inventoryorganizations to participate with itself. Inventory availability of consumableinventory organizations can be accounted as part of inventory availability of theconsuming inventory organization. A consumable inventory organization cannot bea consuming inventory organization of another inventory organization. This meansthat only one level of relationship is allowed.Inventory Consignment enables consuming inventory organizations to maintain aninventory at a consumable inventory organization until just prior to shipping, atwhich point ownership of the inventory is transferred from the consumableinventory organization to the consuming inventory organization. This enables aconsuming inventory organization to greatly reduce its carrying cost, while stillmaintaining an accurate inventory picture because while it does not technicallyown the inventory until it is shipped, it can still be counted as an availableinventory.In an enterprise and vendor model, a enterprise's inventory organization can beconfigured as a consuming inventory organization. Inventory organizations ofvendors, who participate with the enterprise, can be configured as a consumableinventory organizations.Note: When transferring inventory ownership, the system assumes that theconsumable inventory organization and consuming inventory organization havethe same product class.While obtaining availability of a consumable inventory organization throughpromising functions, system will try to maximize its availability by assigning theexcess demand of the consuming inventory organization to other participatingconsumable inventory organizations first, if possible.Inventory rules are read based on the consuming inventory organization. In aconfiguration where a consumable inventory organization participates withmultiple consuming inventory organizations, the system validates whether all theparticipating consuming inventory organizations have the same set of inventoryrules. These inventory rules are Rules within ATP rules such as Use Item Based Allocation, Use Future Supply of Inventory Node Control, Future Supply TypeSafety Factor Percentage, Onhand Supply Type Safety Factor Percentage, andDefault Distribution Rule ID.The inventory rules of the consuming inventory organization will be used whileobtaining inventory availability for the consuming inventory organization andconsumable inventory organization. The sourcing and scheduling related rules ofthe inquiring organization will be used for the promising functions."
Checking Inventory Availability of an Item with Variations,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the ability to check inventoryavailability of an item with variations, based on a specified set of attributes. Thisfeature includes the following functionality:Filtering inventory by attributes and child itemsMaintaining supply and demand for the item with variations and child itemsNote: The behavior of some APIs has changed as a result of the introduction ofthe Inventory Availability of an Item with Variations feature. For informationabout behavior changes in these APIs, refer to the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation: Javadocs.Filtering Inventory by Attributes and Child ItemsSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation allows you to check the inventoryavailability of an item with variations by specifying a child item or a set ofattributes, such as style, size, and color. For example, you can check the availabilityof open-toe shoes in size seven.If no children or attributes are specified when checking the availability of an itemwith variations, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides informationabout the item with variations and all its child items. If you specify a child item ora set of attributes, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation checks availabilityfor only the items that meet the specified criteria.Filtering by Attributes and Child ItemsThe following table provides inventory information about child items of the itemwith variations, Tshirt.Filtering by Attributes and Child ItemsIn this example, if you check inventory availability for Tshirt without specifyingany attributes, the system returns the onhand quantity as 64. If you checkinventory availability for Tshirt and specify the Red attribute, the system returns the onhand quantity as 41. If you check inventory availability for theTshirt_red_large child item, the system returns the onhand quantity as 20.Maintaining Supply and Demand for the Item with Variations andChild ItemsThe overall availability of the item with variations is equal to the sum of theavailability for all child items. Demand is not placed against items with variations.Supply and demand for individual child items is maintained separately for eachitem. Thus, the supply for one child item cannot be used to satisfy the demand fora different child item. For example, available open-toe shoes cannot be used tofulfill a shortage in sling-back shoes.Calculating Supply and Demand for Child ItemsThe following table provides inventory information about the child items of theitem with variations, Tshirt.Calculating Supply and Demand for Child ItemsIn this example, availability for the item with variations Tshirt is calculated byadding the available quantity for all child items (10 + 9 + 0 + 0), which equals 19available Tshirts.This example also demonstrates that the supply and demand for each child item iscalculated separately. Thus, the available quantity forTshirt_red is returned as 10, Tshirt_blue as 9, Tshirt_green as 0, and Tshirt_white as0. Additionally, the available quantity for Tshirt_red or Tshirt_blue cannot be usedto meet a shortage of Tshirt_white.Tshirt_white returns a shortage of 10."
Multiple Fulfillment Items for One Ordered Item,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the ability to check inventoryavailability of an item on an order across multiple fulfillment items in a catalog. Inthis scenario, ""fulfillment items"" are items, supplied by one or more vendors, thatare used to fulfill demand for an ""ordered item"", which is the item on the order.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses the Global Trade Item Number(GTIN) to identify the fulfillment items and the ordered item. The same GTIN isassigned to the ordered item and the corresponding fulfillment items. Additionally,the ordered item and fulfillment items must use the same unit of measure and thesame organization code. However, unique ItemIDs are assigned to all items.When an order is placed for an item, inventory availability is checked against allfulfillment items sharing the same GTIN. Orders are scheduled against the ordered item, not the fulfillment item. However, anytime Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation notifies an external source for fulfillment purposes, the system refers tothe fulfillment item and not to the ordered item.Notification of an external source occurs during order release, drop-ship orders,and procurement orders. The parameter ""Use Fulfillment Item When Order IsCreated as Chained Order"" enables inventory tracking on procurement orders anddrop-ship orders. For more information about tracking inventory on procurementorders and drop-ship orders, refer to the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation:Supply Collaboration Configuration Guide.Demand is placed against fulfillment items, not the ordered item. If a fulfillmentitem of a specific ItemID is not available, demand is placed against anotherfulfillment item that uses a matching GTIN. If no fulfillment items with the sameGTIN are available, the item is backordered against the ItemID on the order.To enable the Multiple Fulfillment Items for One Ordered Item functionality,ensure that the following conditions are met:The ordered item and the fulfillment items belong to the same catalog.All organizations belong to the same inventory organization.The same GTIN is assigned to the ordered item and the fulfillment items. Theordered item and fulfillment items must also share the same unit of measure,organization code, and inventory parameters.The ""Read Availability Across Items Sharing the Same"" parameter in the SterlingGlobal Inventory Visibility application is set to ""GTIN"". For more informationabout this option, refer to the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: GlobalInventory Visibility Configuration Guide.If you want to use the Multiple Fulfillment Items for One Ordered Itemfunctionality, you cannot use the same GTIN across catalog organizations forinventory consignment. For more information about inventory consignment, referto ""Inventory Consignment"".Note: The behavior of some APIs has changed as a result of the introduction of theMultiple Fulfillment Items for One Ordered Item feature. For information aboutbehavior changes in these APIs, refer to the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation: Javadocs.Multiple Fulfillment Items for One Ordered ItemThe following table provides information about the fulfillment items that can beused to fulfill demand for the ordered item, Paper.In this example, when a customer places an order for Paper, Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation checks the availability of all the fulfillment items with aGTIN of 1234. In this case, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation reports theonhand quantity for Paper as 41 items. When the order is placed for Paper, any one of the items with a GTIN of 1234 can be used to fulfill the order. Thus,PaperA, PaperB, or PaperC can be used to fulfill the order.The order is scheduled against the item Paper; however, the release order is madeagainst any one of the corresponding fulfillment items, such as PaperA."
An Overview of Catalogs,"Catalogs are hierarchies of items, organized into groups for different purposes.IBM Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation supports the following types ofcatalogs:Master CatalogSelling CatalogActive Selling Catalog"
Master Catalog,"The master catalog is a hierarchy of items, organized into groups for ease of itemmaintenance. It is created by default when a catalog organization is defined.Typically, the hierarchical structure of the master catalog is flat or has little depth.This structure facilitates item maintenance. The master catalog and the itemswithin it are usually maintained by the catalog organization. However, in somecases, a subcatalog organization may be authorized to manage parts of the mastercatalog.Note: Only one master catalog can exist for a catalog organization."
Selling Catalog,"A selling catalog is a hierarchy of item groups that are organized to facilitate itemsales. Typically, a selling catalog is displayed to customers as a Web channelcatalog. Therefore, the structure of the selling catalog is usually deep, withmultiple layers. This structure enhances customers' ability to locate and buy items.A business may define only one selling catalog, for example, a business may usethe master catalog for item maintenance and also designate it as the selling catalog.However, businesses typically define several selling catalogs, such as seasonalcatalogs for fall, winter, summer, and spring sales.Note: Only one selling catalog can be active at a time."
Active Selling Catalog,"Organizations can define any number of selling catalogs. However, only one sellingcatalog can be active at a time. The active selling catalog is used by a business asits Web channel catalog.For example, in the following figure, the summer selling catalog can be designatedas the active selling catalog during the summer months, and the winter sellingcatalog can be designated as the active selling catalog during the winter months."
Categories,"Catalogs are organized into groups of items called categories, which enable yourcatalog to classify an entire item set in a number of different hierarchical andsearchable groupings. After defining the categories for a catalog, you can add itemsand assign attributes to the categories. The previous figure shows a master catalog,the winter and summer selling catalogs, and the categories that make up eachcatalog."
Kit Items,"A kit item is an individual item comprising various components. For example, acomputer is a kit item, and items such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, and otherperipherals are its components.Kit items can be of three types:Physical KitsDynamic Physical KitsBundles"
Physical Kit,"A physical kit is maintained as a single item and is not disintegrated intocomponents. It is considered a finished product at a node or at the time ofdispatch. For example, a cellular phone with its battery and handset is apreconfigured physical kit.Physical kits can be of the preconfigured type, such as a cellular phone. Forexample, a seller may configure a laptop with a 250 GB hard drive, 3 GB RAM,and a CD-RW/DVD-RW drive, and sell the laptop as a single item. Because thelaptop comprises different components that cannot be sold separately, the laptop isa physical kit.The inventory for a physical kit is maintained at the kit item (parent) level."
Dynamic Physical Kit,"A dynamic physical kit comprises various components. A decision about whichcomponents have to be shipped is decided at the time of creating an order. Forexample, a buyer may place an order for a computer, including the components.The buyer might want the CPU, monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but not thespeakers. This forms a dynamos physical kit. The inventory for this is maintainedat the kit item (parent) level."
Bundle,"A bundle is a kit item that consists of many components. A bundle's componentscan be products, provided services, physical kits, or other bundles. However, adelivery service cannot be a component of a bundle.The inventory for a bundle is maintained at the component level. Inventory tagscan be given to a bundle, but they are ignored by the application.The item Bedroom Set, which includes the components Bed Set, Dress Set,Entertainment Set, and so on, is an example of a bundle. The Bed Set, Dresser Set,and Entertainment Set can in turn, be individual bundles by themselves."
"Models, Configurable Items, and Preconfigured Items","In addition to physical kits, dynamic physical kits, and bundles, other item typesexist that overlap or share these kit types. In IBM Sterling Configurator VisualModeler, you can create a model that defines all the configurable options availablefor an item. After creating a model item, you can associate it to the correspondingbundle item. Like a bundle item, a model item can be a kit that consists ofmultiple components.If an item is configurable, a customer can build that item in theSterlingConfigurator Visual Modeler application based on the associated model. You canalso define preconfigurations of a configurable item in the Sterling Business Centerapplication, and customers can later select from these preconfigurations andmodify preconfigurations for which an order has been placed.When you reconfigure a preconfigured item, that item is replaced with theconfigurable item associated to the model used. Any time that you reconfigureitems, pricing can be affected.For more information about defining models, see the Sterling Configurator VisualModeler: Administration Guide."
Item Associations,"There are five types of associations that can be made between product items:Cross-SellUp-SellSupersessionAlternativeCompetitiveAll association types, except supersession, allow you to associate items to otheritems, to categories of items, and to queries of items. Supersession supports onlyitem-to-item associations. For example, you can create a query to retrieve all thelaptops with 120 GB hard drives, and then define an up-sell to associate smallerlaptops with the queried laptops."
Cross-Sell,"A cross-sell promotes an add-on or accessory item that, when combined with theprimary item, makes a ""better"" package.Let us, for example, assume that there is a shirt in your inventory that matches apair of shoes. When you create the shoes item in the catalog, you associate theshirt as a cross-sell. This way, when the customer orders the shoes, it is possible tonotify them about the matching shirt."
Up-Sell,"An up-sell promotes a more powerful or higher-level item.Let us, for example, presume that your inventory has a certain model of runningshow that is available in two versions, inexpensive and expensive. When youcreate a catalog item for the inexpensive shoes you associate the more expensiveshoes as an up-sell. When a customer tries to order the inexpensive shoes, it ispossible to notify them about the expensive option."
Supersession,"Setting up a supersession association provides the ability to recognize that anordered item can be superseded by a chain of items. An item is superseded whenits effective date becomes obsolete. Typically, obsolete items are not offered tocustomers who perform a regular search of your business's Web site. However, if acustomer performs an advanced search, looking specifically for obsolete items, heis offered the next item in the chain of supersession. Additionally, if an itembecomes unavailable, such as an item that has sold out, the system tries to orderthe next item in the chain of supersession.A chain of supersession can include as many items as you want. However, youshould not specify more than one chain of supersession per item. For example, youcan configure item A to be superseded by item B, which in turn can be supersededby item C; however, you cannot specify that both items B and C should directly supersede item A. When configuring supersession, ensure that you specify similaritems that are comparably-priced, such as different versions of software.Let us, for example, presume that in your catalog, you have an automotive partthat is sold under a new model number each year. You configure supersession forthe part (Part A is superseded by Part B). Part A is now obsolete. If a customersearches your Web site for the part, the system does not display results for thesearch.However, if the customer performs an advanced search that specifically includesobsolete parts, the system informs the customer that Part A is obsolete and offersthe customer Part B because it supersedes Part A.Let us consider a similar scenario where Part A is sold out and is no longeravailable. Without supersession, a customer who tries to buy Part A may be toldthat it is not available, even though it is available as Part B. However, ifsupersession is configured, the system offers Part B to the customer."
Preferred Substitutes,"A preferred substitute is an item that should be fulfilled first, prior to fulfilling theoriginal item. The system verifies and fulfills the order by shipping the preferredsubstitute item even when the original item is available. For example, if an order isplaced for Item1, but Item2 is the preferred substitute, Item2 is depleted prior toshipping Item1. The ratio between the preferred substitute and the original itemshould always be 1.When a preferred substitute is available, the order is scheduled completely againstthat preferred substitute. Although partial scheduling against the preferredsubstitute or the original item is not possible, partial procurement is allowed whenpreferred substitutes are not available.Note: Preferred substitutes have limitations such as:Invoicing is done based on the original dimensions of the item.Tag-controlled items cannot use preferred substitutes.The product or service associations of the original item is used.The capacity of the original item is used.Routing is done based on the original dimensions of the item."
Alternative,"An alternative association provides the ability to choose an item that is verysimilar to the original as an alternative. The system prompts a customer to confirmthe alternative item before it is ordered.Let us, for example, presume that in your inventory you have a popular brand ofshoe that sells out quickly. Your inventory also has other comparable brands ofshoes that are popular but do not sell as much. When you create a catalog item forthe popular brand of shoes, you associate the other brands as alternatives. When acustomer orders the popular brand of shoes and if that brand is not in stock, thesystem provides the customer with the option of buying the alternate brand ofshoes. However, only after the customer confirms that the alternative brand isacceptable does the order get placed."
Competitive,"Competitive association involves associating similar items from differentmanufacturers. You can also use this association to track products fromcompetitors.For example, if a store sells a basketball shoe made by Company X, they mightalso offer buyers a similar basketball shoe made by Company Y."
Product Services: Delivery Services and Provided Services,"In addition to shipped products, Catalog Management™ provides the capability tomanage delivery services and provided services.Shipped products are physical products that are purchased and shipped to acustomer, for example, a piano.Delivery Services are billable services that are directly associated with a product in asales order or a return order, for example, the delivery of a high-definitiontelevision. Stand-alone delivery service lines can also be created, and if required,associated with a product at a later time.Provided Services are billable services that are offered to enhance the life or usabilityof a product associated with a sales order or a return order, for example, fabricprotection for a sofa or installation service for a home theater system.Delivery Services and Provided Services are also defined as items by the catalogorganization and are available to all the organizations that share that catalogorganization.Each service item is assigned a service type. Service types are used to identify thecapacity UOM for the service items. Delivery Service Types can be used tocompute additional capacity. In addition, service levels are used to indicate thecomplexity of the assigned service type.For each service, a list of valid service options are also created as items andassociated to the respective service item.Besides setting up Delivery and Provided Service items, the catalog must alsoinclude the definition of the list of delivery and provided service items availablefor products. This association can be set up either at any level within an ItemClassification hierarchy or at an individual product item level.As with item associations, you can also have product, provided, and deliveryservices."
Containers,"Catalog Management provides the capability to manage containers that can holditems.Within Catalog Management, containers are defined as items for a catalogorganization and are available to all the organizations sharing that catalogorganization. By defining containers as items, containers can be managed in thesame ways that items can. Like other items, containers can consist of components,and can be kit items.Containerization is a process that assigns items to containers based on thealgorithms defined in the corresponding organization. Defining a containerinvolves defining one or more of the following attributes that are used incontainerization:Physical characteristics, such the container’s volume and the weight that it canhold.Container capacity based on item classificationContainerization categoriesBuyer of the items being containerized"
Physical Characteristics,"The physical characteristics that you specify for a container are used to determineits basic physical capabilities. If you specify that a container can carry a weight ofup to 20 kilos, and the item you are shipping weighs 50 kilos, this container cannotbe used. If multiple items are being containerized, the container’s volumedetermines if it can hold all the items.Note: Some of the items that are being containerized may be in boxes or haveregular shapes, such as books. This simplifies the calculations about whether acontainer can successfully hold them."
Capacity by Item Classification,"Some items may be irregular in shape, such as soccer balls, or can be compressedwhen packed, such as sweatshirts. To accommodate items such as these, you canestablish classifications to determine the number of items that can be placed in thecontainer.For example, if you are selling sporting goods, create classifications for the varioustypes of balls you sell, small, average, and large. You can then assign theseclassifications to the corresponding items as shown in the following table.When creating an item description for a container, you can use the followingclassifications to indicate the quantity that the container can hold for eachclassification, shown in the following table."
Containerization Categories,"You can also establish various containerization categories, and then specify thatcontainers can accept only the items that are in that categorization category. Thisenables you to ensure the following:Associating hazardous materials with appropriate containersEnsuring that products containing liquids are packed in waterproof containersShipping certain items using premium packaging"
Buyer,"You can also indicate that a container should be used only for specific buyers. Thisindication will be based on your knowledge about buyer’s requirements. This mayinclude size restrictions in the buyer’s facilities, special packaging requirements, orproviding containers marked with a special logo."
Items with Variations,"An item with variations is a grouping of items that have similar characteristics andare displayed as a single item in product search results. This grouping is usefulwhen limiting the individual items that are returned during a product search.For example, if you are searching a catalog for a polo-shirt, you usually receive amatch that includes three styles (short-sleeve, long-sleeve, active) along with thecolors and sizes in which each style is offered. However, for an item withvariations, the initial search result returns only the styles available. Color and sizeselection are available after the style is selected, limiting the number of resultsreturned by the initial search.This can be accomplished by creating an item with variations and children itemsfor each product. The following table shows an item with variations and probablechild items it could have.Child items of an item with variations are automatically assigned to the samecategory or classification to which the parent item is assigned."
Assets,"Asset is the term used to describe an electronic media file that you can associatewith a business object. Assets can be of many kinds, URLs, datasheets, image files,sound files, and text files. Typically, they are digitally-based objects that reside inthe system. You can assign assets to items, catalogs, categories, attributes, andattribute allowed values. When a customer accesses a business object with anassociated asset, the asset is also displayed. For example, if you assign image filesto items that are sold from an online catalog, customers can view the pictures ofitems they intend to buy."
Defining Attributes,"Attributes are characteristics or specifications that define the corresponding systementities. For example, a computer's attributes may include:Type of CPUHard drive size in GBNumber of USB portsYou can define a set of allowed values for attributes; for example, in the context ofthe CPU type, you can define the allowed values as AMD, Celeron, and Pentium.Enterprises create and manage system attributes by first defining the followingmaster attribute data:Attribute domainsAttribute groupsAttributes and allowed attribute values.Note: You assign attributes and derived attributes to categories, but you cannotassign values to derived attributes. Only the decimal and integer data type issupported as a valid value for derived attributes.The following figure depicts a branch of a typical attribute domain, in this case, theitem attribute domain."
Attribute Domains,"An attribute domain is a hierarchy of attribute groups that contain similar types ofattributes. For example, the item attribute domain contains groups of itemattributes.Note: The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation supports only the itemattribute domain, which is automatically created when a catalog organization isdefined."
Attribute Groups,"An attribute group is a set of related attributes that share a common purpose. Forexample, you can define an attribute group called Performance that containsPerformance-related attributes for different types of items. You can then assignCPU Speed and CPU Type as Performance attributes of Computers andAcceleration as a Performance attribute of Toy Cars.Multiple levels of attribute groups allow you to easily manage large numbers ofattributes by prioritizing and organizing attributes. If the business in the exampleprovided in the previous paragraph wants to emphasize its computer-relatedproducts, CPU Speed and CPU Type can be listed higher in the attribute group'shierarchical tree than Acceleration, the Toy Car-related attribute."
Attributes,"Attributes can be defined as characteristics of system entities. For example, CPUSpeed and Ram Size can be defined as computer attributes. The Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation supports the following attributes:Attributes with valid valuesDerived attributesAttributes by ReferenceAttributes with Valid ValuesThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation enables you to define attributeswith the following data types:Text defines the attribute as a text value. Text properties can be defined either asfree-form text or as a defined list of values, such as small, medium, and large.You can configure multiple values for an attribute and a maximum characterlength for free-form text. You can also specify a default value.Boolean defines the attribute as a Y/N value. You can also specify a defaultvalue of Y or N.Decimal and Integer defines the attribute as a numerical value in decimal orinteger format. You can specify a range of allowed numbers, such as 60-180,allow any number or a range of incremental values. For example, you can definea range of allowed values for the Hard Drive Size attribute in increments of 60GB, such as 60 GB, 120 GB, 180 GB and so on. You can also configure a defaultvalue and a multiple list of values.Derived attributesDerived attributes are attributes that represent a specific aspect of anotherattribute. You can define multiple derived attributes for an attribute and assign these derived attributes to different categories. For example, you can define twoderived attributes called Dimension Range and associate them with the Dimensionattributes in the TVs and Computers category. When an online customer searchesfor TVs, the system calculates the dimension range for each TV, based on the TV'sdimensions, and displays the TVs in the appropriate ranges. Online customers canlocate 32-inch TVs in the 32-35 inch range and 40-inch TVs in the 40-50 inch range.Note: You assign attributes and derived attributes to categories but cannot assignvalues to derived attributes.Only the decimal and integer data type is supported as a valid value for derivedattributes.Attributes by ReferenceAttribute management allows you to dynamically create and assign attributeswithout extending database tables. However, in some cases, you may want to useattributes that reference database fields, such as the yfs_item table. In this case, theassigned values of the attribute are extracted from the corresponding field in thedatabase table. For example, if an attribute called Lead Time refers to the LeadTime field in the yfs_item table, the value for the item attribute information istaken from the Lead Time field in the yfs_item table."
Item Attribute Management,"Item attribute management enables you to create and manage attributes for itemsand categories. Item attribute management involves the following processes:Defining attribute groups, attributes, and allowed attribute values.Note: The item attribute domain is automatically created when you define acatalog organization. Only one attribute domain is supported by a catalogorganization. For information about defining attributes, attribute groups, andallowed attribute values, refer to Chapter 9, “Defining Attributes,” on page 19.Assigning attributes to categories and classificationsAssigning values for category and item attributes"
Assigning Attributes to Categories and Classifications,"After configuring master data for item-related attributes, assign these attributes tocategories and classifications. When you assign an attribute to a category, theattribute is inherited by child categories, classifications, and items within thecategories. Inherited attributes allow you to easily assign attributes to largenumbers of items. For example, if you assign the Hard Drive Size attribute to theComputer category, the categories and item listed in the following table inherit theHard Drive Size attribute.Note: Categories managed by subcatalog organizations do not inherit attributesand attribute values from the catalog organization.When assigning attributes to categories and classifications, you can also defineusages for attributes, such as attributes for filtering or comparing items. Forexample, by defining Port Type as a filterable attribute and Port Type, Hard DriveSize, and CPU Type as specification attributes, customers can search a businessorganization’s Web site for computers by Port Type and view a computer’s PortType, Hard Drive Size, and CPU Type on the specifications page.You can assign the following usages to an attribute:Searching specifies that this attribute is used for searches.Filtering specifies that this attribute is used to narrow the search results on abusiness’ Web site.Specifications specifies that this attribute is displayed as an item specification onthe business’ Web site.Distinct Attribute specifies that this attribute is used to define Items withVariations."
Assigning Values for Category and Item Attributes,"After attributes are assigned to categories and classifications, you can assign valuesto attributes at the category and item levels. When you assign a value to anattribute in a category, the value is inherited by attributes in child categories,classifications, and items in those categories. For example, if you assign 240 GB asa value for Hard Drive Size in the Laptop category, all Laptop subcategories anditems in those categories inherit 240 GB as the value for Hard Drive Size.However if a child category has already assigned the attribute’s values, the childcategory does not inherit the parent category’s attribute values.You can modify inherited attribute values at the following levels:CategoryItemModifying Inherited Attribute Values at the Category LevelIf you modify inherited attribute values in a child category, the child categorybecomes the owner of the attribute values. The attribute value is no longer definedby the parent category. For example, if the color attribute in the Shirts categoryinherits the values red, blue, and orange from its parent category, Clothing, andyou change the attribute values at the Shirts category level to pink and purple, thecategorization provided in the following table is trueIn this example, the color attribute no longer inherits any values from the Clothingcategory after the color attribute is modified at the Shirts category level. You addedthe colors pink and purple at the Shirts category level. Therefore, the values for thecolor attribute are defined at the Shirts category level as pink and purple. If youthen add the color green at the Clothing category level, the categorization providedin the following table is true:Modifying Inherited Attribute Values at the Item LevelYou can modify item attribute values that an item inherits from a parent category.However, the category continues to own the attribute values. If you change theattribute value at the parent category level after modifying the child item attributevalue, the item inherits the attribute value from the parent category.For example, if a color attribute for the Shirt item inherits the values red, blue, andorange from the Shirts category and then you change the attribute at the item levelby adding the value pink, the attribute value for the Shirt item is redefined as thevalues red, blue, orange, and pink. If you then modify the Color attribute at theShirts category level by adding the value purple, the categorization provided in thefollowing table is true:"
An Overview of Catalog Organizations and Subcatalog Organizations,"Typically, a catalog organization defines an item master that is shared with theother organizations in a participant model. The item master is defined in only onecatalog, called the master catalog, eliminating the need of other organizations tocreate their own item definition. However, in some business scenarios, you maywant to authorize an organization, other than the catalog organization, to maintaina portion of the master catalog. Although enterprises can share the master catalog,in some cases a catalog organization may want to extend the master catalog toother enterprises, allowing them to manage categories within the catalog.Additionally, the catalog organization can allow some enterprises to accesscategories in the master catalog. The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides the following configurations for catalog management:The catalog organization is an enterprise that maintains the master catalog anddefines other enterprises as subcatalog organizations. The catalog organizationauthorizes subcatalog organizations to manage the categories within the mastercatalog and defines seller entitlements that grant or restrict other organizations'access to categories within the master catalog. Depending on an organization'sseller entitlements, the organization may be able to view or sell catalog items thatare maintained by the catalog organization or other organizations.Subcatalog organizations are enterprises that refer to a catalog organization as theircatalog organization. If a vendor or seller is an enterprise, it can be set up as asubcatalog organization. Subcatalog organizations can perform the followingfunctions:Manage categories within the master catalogManage items within categories in the master catalogAssign catalog organization attributes to subcatalog categories and itemsAssign items from the master catalog to the subcatalog organization's categoriesNote: By default, subcatalog organizations can view all items in the catalogorganization's catalog. If you want to restrict the items that subcatalogorganizations can view, you must configure seller entitlements for the subcatalogorganizations. Ensure that all items in the catalog are assigned to categoriesbecause seller entitlements rules are configured and assigned by category."
Managing Categories within the Master Catalog,"Catalog organizations can authorize subcatalog organizations to manage thecategories within the master catalog. However, only one subcatalog organizationcan manage a category. For example, a catalog organization may define a Memorycategory in the catalog and authorize XYZ-Vendor, the subcatalog organization, tomanage the XYZ-Vendor category under the Memory category. Only XYZ-Vendorcan add items to the XYZ-Vendor category and create subcategories underXYZ-Vendor."
Managing Items within Categories in the Master Catalog,"If the catalog organization has authorized a subcatalog organization to manage acategory, the subcatalog organization is responsible for creating, assigning, andmaintaining items within the authorized category. A subcatalog’s items cannot beedited by the catalog organization or another subcatalog organization, and thesubcatalog’s items are unique within the catalog. After a subcatalog organizationassigns an item to a category or creates an item or category, the subcatalogorganization owns that item or category."
Assigning Catalog Organization Attributes to Subcatalog Categories,"A subcatalog organization can assign attributes of the catalog organization to itsown categories. Child categories that are managed by the subcatalog organizationinherit these assigned attributes. If a catalog organization assigns attributes to acategory containing subcategories that are managed by a subcatalog organization,the subcatalog’s categories do not inherit the attributes.Additionally, a subcatalog organization can assign attribute values to its owncategories and items. Child categories and items inherit these assigned attributevalues. However, a subcatalog organization cannot assign attribute values tocategories and items managed by the catalog organization. These assigned attributevalues are not inherited by items that are managed by the catalog organization.For example, if the subcatalog organization XYZ-Retail assigns the Size attributevalues to its XYZ-Retail clothing category and the XYZ-Retail clothing categorycontains items managed by the catalog organization, the Size attribute values areassigned only to the items managed by XYZ-Retail. The Size attribute values arenot assigned to the items managed by the catalog organization."
Assigning Items from the Master Catalog to the Subcatalog's Categories,"A subcatalog organization can assign items from the master catalog to its owncategories. The catalog organization must configure seller entitlements for thesubcatalog organization before the subcatalog organization can access categories inthe master catalog. With the appropriate entitlements, a subcatalog organizationcan sell items that are created and maintained by the catalog organization andother subcatalog organizations."
Subcatalog Organization: An Example,"XYZ-CORP is an enterprise and a catalog organization that maintains items, suchas processors, motherboards, and chipsets. It defines the following subcatalogorganizations:XYZ-Vendor, an enterprise and supplier of XYZ-CORP, makes memory chips.XYZ-CORP creates the XYZ-Vendor category in the catalog and authorizesXYZ-Vendor to extend the catalog by managing the XYZ-Vendor category.XYZ-Vendor adds its own items to the XYZ-Vendor category and is responsiblefor managing the XYZ-Vendor category and the items within it. Additionally,XYZ-Vendor is authorized to create and manage categories within theXYZ-Vendor category, such as the Perfect category.XYZ-Retail, an enterprise and seller of some XYZ-CORP items, primarily sellscomputer hardware. XYZ-CORP defines seller entitlements that allow XYZ-Retailto access the Memory and Platform categories in the master catalog. XYZ-Retailcan assign items from the Memory and Platform categories and theirsubcategories to its own categories. This includes items from the XYZ-Vendorcategory, the Perfect category, the Base Y category, and the Base X category.Additionally, XYZ-CORP allows XYZ-Retail to extend the catalog by grantingXYZ-Retail authority to manage the XYZ-Retail category. XYZ-Retail isresponsible for managing the XYZ-Retail category, its subcategories, and theitems contained within them.The following graphic shows the subcatalog example.Categories and Items that XYZ-Retail Can SellIn the previous example, XYZ-CORP defines seller entitlements that allowXYZ-Retail to sell items under the Memory and Platform categories. The Memorycategory contains the XYZ-Vendor category, which is maintained by XYZ-Vendor,and the Perfect subcategory, which is also maintained by XYZ-Vendor. ThePlatform category contains the Base X and Base Y categories, which are maintainedby XYZ-CORP. In the example, XYZ-Retail is entitled to sell items from categoriesmaintained by XYZ-CORP, XYZ-Vendor, and XYZ-Retail.If the Base X category contains the items BaseX-1 and BaseX-2, the Perfect categorycontains the items SDRAM and SODIMM, and the Monitor category contains theitems LCD Fine and LCD Better, XYZ-Retail can sell items from the categorieslisted below:Memory categoryXYZ-Vendor categoryPerfect category, including the items SDRAM and SODIMMPlatform categoryBase X category, including the items BaseX-1 and BaseX-2Base Y categoryXYZ-Retail categoryMonitor category, including the items LCD Fine and LCD BetterPeripherals category"
Guidelines for Defining Subcatalog Organizations,"A catalog organization defines subcatalog organizations by performing thefollowing tasks:Defining enterprises as subcatalog organizations of the catalog organization. Tospecify an organization as a subcatalog organization, the organization must beconfigured as an enterprise, and the catalog organization must be specified as itscatalog organization.Authorizing subcatalog organizations to manage categories in the master catalog.Subcatalog organizations are responsible for maintaining the assigned categories.Defining seller entitlements for subcatalog organizations. Seller entitlementsdetermine the categories in the master catalog to which subcatalog organizationshave access. If you are extending the catalog to a subcatalog organization andwant other subcatalog organizations to be entitled to access its categories, youmust also configure seller entitlements for the other subcatalog organizations.Catalog organizations are entitled to access all master catalog categories.In addition to seller entitlements configured by the catalog organization, asubcatalog organization can set up customer entitlements that determine theitems the subcatalog organization’s customers can buy.Seller entitlements determine what a subcatalog organization can sell andcustomer entitlements determine what customers can buy. The catalogorganization assigns seller entitlements to subcatalog organizations; the catalogorganization and subcatalog organizations assign customer entitlements to theircustomers."
Seller Entitlements and Customer Entitlements,Entitlements enable organizations to manage access to items for buying and sellingpurposes. The Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the followingentitlements:Seller EntitlementsCustomer Entitlements
Seller Entitlements,"Enterprises define seller entitlements that grant and restrict other organizations’access to categories in the catalog. For example, an enterprise allows a supplier tomanage the Brand-X category in the catalog. The enterprise defines sellerentitlements for the organization’s competitor restricting the competitor fromviewing the Brand-X category. Additionally, the enterprise may define sellerentitlements for another organization allowing it to view and sell items from theBrand-X category.Only enterprises that are catalog organizations can define seller entitlements.Moreover, they can define seller entitlements only for enterprises and sellers thathave specified the corresponding catalog organization as their catalog organization.Seller entitlements are defined by configuring the following:Seller Entitlement RulesOrganization Assignments"
Seller Entitlement Rules,"Seller entitlement rules specify the categories that can be assigned to organizationsunder seller entitlements. Categories from the master catalog can be specifiedunder seller entitlement rules. A seller entitlement contains one or more sellerentitlement rules that collectively define the list of categories for the entitlement. Todefine a rule, start with no categories and then add seller entitlement rules toinclude categories; or start with all categories and add seller entitlement rules toexclude categories.Seller Entitlement Rule PrecedenceThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation executes seller entitlement rules ina specified order, with the last rule taking precedence over the first rule. Forexample, you may define a seller entitlement called Computers by starting with nocategories in your catalog and then adding a rule that includes the Computerscategory. If you add another rule that excludes the Laptop category, all desktopcomputers, except for laptops, are selected for the Computers entitlement."
Assigning Organizations to Entitlements,"Organizations are assigned to seller entitlement rules in seller entitlements. Onlyorganizations that specify the catalog organization as their catalog organization canbe assigned in a seller entitlement.Organizations can have multiple seller entitlements. When this occurs, theorganization is entitled to access all categories specified under the combinedentitlements. If one seller entitlement allows access to categories that are restrictedby another seller entitlement, the organization is entitled to all the specifiedcategories, including the categories that are restricted by the second sellerentitlement."
Customer Entitlements,"Customer entitlements allow enterprises to define the items their customers canbuy. For example, an enterprise may restrict a customer from buying items underits Computers category but allow the customer to buy items under its TVscategory.Customer entitlements are defined by configuring the following:Customer Entitlement StrategyCustomer Entitlement RulesCustomer Assignments"
Customer Entitlement Strategy,Customer entitlement strategy allows enterprises to specify rules for enforcingcustomer entitlements. Customer entitlement strategies can be categorized asfollows:Customers can access only the items that are assigned to them in customerentitlements.Customers can access only the items that are assigned to them in pricelists.Customers can access only the items that are assigned to them in both pricelistsand customer entitlements.Customers can access all items regardless of pricelists and customer entitlements.
Customer Entitlement Rules,"Customer entitlement rules specify items that are assigned to customers incustomer entitlements. Only items from the online catalog can be specified undercustomer entitlement rules. An organization can define its own customerentitlement rules or inherit customer entitlement rules from another enterprise. Forinformation about inheriting enterprise-level rules from another enterprise, refer tothe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Configuration Guide.A customer entitlement contains one or more customer entitlement rules thatcollectively define the list of items for the entitlement. To define a rule, start withno categories and then add customer entitlement rules to include items; or startwith all items in your online catalog and add customer entitlement rules to excludeitems. Items can be included by categories of items or by item attributes.Note: You cannot use derived, computed, or reference attributes in customerentitlement rules.Customer Entitlement Rule PrecedenceThe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation executes customer entitlementrules in a specified order, with the last rule taking precedence over the firstspecified rule. For example, you may define a customer entitlement called TVs byfirst adding a customer entitlement rule that includes all TVs brands in the TVcategory and then add another rule that excludes Brand-X TVs. The last specifiedcustomer entitlement rule takes precedence; in this example, customers assigned tothe TVs customer entitlement can access all TV brands except Brand-X TVs."
Assign Customers to Entitlements,"Customers are assigned to entitlement rules either directly or dynamically. TheSterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the following dynamiccustomer assignments:Vertical customers, such as education and government customers.Relationship Type, customers such as resellers and distributors.Customer Level, such as platinum and gold customers.Region, determined by mapping the customer's address to a region defined inthe Region Schema.When dynamic assignments are specified, customers belonging to the specifiedgroups are assigned to the corresponding customer entitlement. For example, ifyou select the platinum membership level for a customer assignment, allplatinum-level customers are assigned to that customer entitlement.A customer can have multiple customer entitlements. When this occurs, thecustomer is entitled to all the items specified by the combined entitlements. If onecustomer entitlement includes items that are excluded by another customerentitlement, the customer is entitled to all the specified items, including the itemsthat are excluded by the second customer entitlement.Direct AssignmentYou can specify that an enterprise must allow only direct assignments for acustomer. If a customer is assigned directly and dynamically to differententitlements, only direct assignment is allowed. For example, if a B2C customer isdirectly assigned to the TVs customer entitlement and dynamically assigned to theComputers customer entitlement, the customer is entitled to only the itemsspecified in the TVs entitlement. However, if you do not specify Use DirectAssignment if Exists, the customer is entitled to all the items specified under theTVs and Computers customer entitlements."
Seller Entitlements and Customer Entitlements:An Example,"Seller entitlements allow a catalog organization to control other organizations'access to categories in the master catalog. Depending on its seller entitlements, anorganization may be able to view categories managed by the catalog organizationor another organization; or, an organization may be restricted from viewing acompetitor's categories in the catalog. Additionally, an organization may be entitledto sell items from specified categories in the catalog.Customer entitlements allow an enterprise to define items its customers can buy. Ifseller entitlements allow an enterprise to sell catalog items that are managed by thecatalog organization or another organization, the enterprise can sell those items toits customers by defining customer entitlements for its customers.In the following figure, XYZ-CORP is an enterprise and catalog organization thatallows XYZ-Retail, a XYZ-CORP subcatalog organization, to sell items from thecatalog. XYZ-CORP uses seller entitlements to specify that XYZ-Retail can sellitems from the Memory and Platform categories. In this example, XYZ-Retail sellsitems from the Memory and Platform categories, which XYZ-CORP manages.Additionally, XYZ-Retail does not inherit customer entitlement rules fromXYZ-CORP. In this case, XYZ-Retail defines its own customer entitlements, whichdetermine the items XYZ-Retail's customers can buy. However, XYZ-Retail can onlyentitle its customers to buy items that XYZ-Retail is entitled to sell. If XYZ-Retailspecifies the Platform category in a customer entitlement for its customerXYZ-Store, XYZ-Store can buy items from the Platform category, but not from theMemory category."
An Overview of Catalog Search,"Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation provides the Apache Lucene opensource search engine library for conducting fast and accurate searches. The Lucenesearch engine enables catalog organizations to create one searchable index file foreach locale from the data that is available in the Sterling Selling and FulfillmentFoundation database. This index file and a user query, which is defined bycustomer-provided search criteria, return search results in a filtered,easy-to-navigate format.Additionally, the Lucene query parser simplifies the process of entering searchcriteria by providing operators and terms to refine search results.Note: For more information about the Lucene open source search engine libraryand query parser, see the Lucene Web site:http://lucene.apache.orgCatalog search consists of the following processes:Catalog index buildingCatalog searching"
Catalog Index Building,"The Lucene searchable index file contains denormalized item data that has beenextracted from the Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation database. The indexfile stores all the item data that is required for performing fast, scalable searches.Additionally, the index file is stored on the server, further enhancing theperformance of the search. For example, if a customer searches for red shirts, theLucene search engine uses the index file to quickly locate all the item informationpertaining to shirts with the attribute value of red.The Create Catalog Index time-triggered transaction builds an index file for eachsupported locale. The transaction can be configured to perform the following tasks:Build a full or incremental index file for each localeRun scheduled index builds or enable user-initiated index buildsActivate the indexThe transaction refers to an XML configuration file for instructions about buildingthe index file. The default index file configuration includes item data aboutattributes, categories, pricing information, and assets (Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation provides only the HTML format for asset type by default.)Note: You can customize catalog search by extending the corresponding XMLconfiguration file. For example, Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundationprovides only the US-English locale by default. However, you can add a locale,such as Canada-French, by extending the XML configuration file. Data fromexternal sources can be added to the index file by extending the XML configurationfile and by providing a custom implementation of the appropriate user exit. Youcan also add asset types. For more information about customizing item search, seethe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Extending the Database.If any changes are made in the database to the attributes of entities that aredefined in the catalog search XML configuration file, the catalog index must berebuilt, either incrementally or fully. For example, you must rebuild the index afteradding or deleting individual items in entitlement rules, or when an item is addedor removed from a category. The same is true when the price on an item ismodified or added. Additionally, the index must be fully rebuilt when there is apricelist assignment for anonymous or all customers removed.Note: If more than a third of the items in the catalog have changed, it isrecommended that you perform a full index build.For information about the Create Catalog Index time-triggered transaction, refer tothe Time-Triggered Transaction Reference in any of the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation configuration guides. This appendix also describesconfiguration options for accessing catalog index files."
Searching the Catalog,"After the index file is built, customers can search an organization's active sellingcatalog by specifying search criteria. Customers can either enter arbitrary terms,such as Laptop Computer, as search criteria, or enter item attributes based oncategories, to locate specific items. When customers perform keyword searches in aparent category, only items from the parent category are returned; items from childcategories are not returned.Advanced search enables customers to specify item fields and values as searchcriteria. Advanced search also supports the Lucene query parser. Customers canuse special Lucene operators and terms, such as wildcards (#, *), to refine theirsearch.Note: For more information about the Lucene terms and operators that aresupported, see: http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.htmlSearch results return a list of items that match the query formed from the searchcriteria. Typically, item information is retrieved from the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation database. However, information for external attributes isretrieved directly from the index. Information for internal attributes can also beretrieved from the index by setting an attribute's Store value to Y in the extendedXML configuration file. After information is retrieved, it is displayed to thecustomer. The results also display a list of attributes and categories that match thequery and the number of matching items for each attribute and category.Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation uses Ehcache functionality andSearchIndexCache for storing pre-search results of items within categories andfiltered attributes in the catalog for search index. For information about theout-of-the-box Ehcache functionality provided by IBM, refer to the Sterling Sellingand Fulfillment Foundation: Properties Guide. For detailed information about Ehcachefunctionality and how you can configure the elements and settings to enhanceyour cache for catalog search index, see http://ehcache.org/.Note: If the application server is not shut down gracefully, the Ehcache files mustbe cleaned up manually before restarting the application server. The path name forthe location where the Ehcache files are stored is the path name specified in thediskStore element of cacheoverride.xml. For example, <diskStorepath=""/<pathname>""/>. For more information regarding cacheoverride.xml, refer tothe Sterling Selling and Fulfillment Foundation: Properties Guide.Note: The cache is loaded independently for each application server. In somecases, if you are using multiple application servers, different users who are loggedinto different application servers may not get the same search results when a newindex is activated.Note: See information pertaining to the searchCatalogIndex API in the SterlingSelling and Fulfillment Foundation: Javadocs."
Catalog Index Building: Guidelines,"A catalog organization must build an index of the items in the Sterling Selling andFulfillment Foundation database before customers can run a catalog search. To setup index building, perform the following tasks:Configure the Create Catalog Index time-triggered transactionSpecify a location for storing index filesIn addition to these mandatory configuration tasks, administrators have the optionof configuring synonyms that enable customers to perform a search based onrelated terms. You can also customize the search configuration by extending thecatalog search XML configuration file. For example, if you want the search tosupport additional locales, extend the catalog search XML configuration file."
Waves,"A wave is an aggregation of picks across zones and orders that are consolidated tooptimize pick and prioritize shipment. Wave planning is very effective in highvolume pick or pack environments as it optimizes the labor costs. For low volumepick and pack warehouses (stores, stockrooms or low volume of orders), supportcustomer pick-up or for one-off shipments (urgent orders), it may be more effectiveto release shipments individually rather than group into waves.The demand at a wave level for a shipment is grouped and is further broken intothe method of pick to be employed using Pick Strategy, and where to pick theinventory using Pick Location Assignment. Containerization process is alsoapplied, if necessary, considering customer and SKU specific constraints.It is important in a warehouse to manage the total work issued on the system atany given time. The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows control overthe number of waves picked in parallel at a shipment group level. For example, awarehouse having 5 pre-defined shipment groups can ensure that each shipmentgroup releases and picks only one wave by setting the values to 1 at a shipmentgroup level."
Accepting Waves,"Waves that are created can be released automatically or manually. Somewarehouses may choose to monitor the waves that are created, and decide theirmanual release. This manual decision is called ""accepting the wave"". Shipmentsbelonging to waves that are not accepted would be considered for inclusion intonew waves.The acceptance of a wave in the Sterling Warehouse Management System can beautomatically or conditionally accepted based on constraints such as volume,weight constraints or configured to be always accepted non-conditionallydepending on shipment group configuration. Also, you can accept a wavemanually."
Lane Assignments,"Lane assignment is typically used in warehouses that have either large number ofshipments or carriers being used every day. Sorters may be employed to improvethe flow-through of containers for these shipments after they are picked andpacked.Shipments are sorted either by carrier or shipments. However, shipments are firstsorted by carrier to ensure that all shipments being shipped by a particular carrierare kept together to aid loading of a carrier's truck when it arrives. Then,shipments are sorted by shipments to ensure that shipments being picked frommultiple zones in a warehouse are consolidated before shipping the shipment. Inthe case of LTL or TL shipments, shipments are sorted into pallets by scanning thecontainers. To aid this sorting process, the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemassigns lanes to each shipment. The following figure depicts "
Releasing Waves,"A warehouse also specifies the release time for waves. For example, a shipmentgroup specified for a customer specifying a particular 'day of the week', becausethe delivery date requires waves to be released on a specific day. The releaseschedule considers waves that have been accepted for release.Shipments that do not have sufficient inventory are removed from a wave. Forshipments that require segmented inventory, the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem automatically checks released work orders for excess inventory that may beavailable, and creates a work order for the remaining quantity, if necessary, tocreate segmented inventory to fulfill the shipment.Based on the demand, the Sterling Warehouse Management System Release Wavesearches for inventory at a wave level in specific zones, and creates pick tasks foravailable inventory.Buyer ComplianceA buyer organization may choose to use units of measure defined in the buyer'scatalog. In such a situation, at the time of picking it is ensured that products arepicked in UOMs supported by the buyer organization. To achieve this, UOMs fromthe buyer's catalog is compared with the enterprise's catalog. The SterlingWarehouse Management System ensures that the UOMs defined in both thecatalogs and with same quantities are considered for picking.Over-PackingThe Sterling Warehouse Management System considers over-pack when UOMsdefined in the buyer's catalog are not used. In such case, multiple smallercontainers needs to be placed into a bigger container. However, this operation isoptional and can be defined in the Pack Planning configuration at thenode-enterprise level.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows the performance of over-packon specific constraints like containerization, category, and volume. If UOM is notapplicable for shipment line's containerization category (item classification forContainerization Category), the Sterling Warehouse Management System considersonly those UOMs defined in the enterprise's catalog for picking. However, ifover-pack is applicable, UOMs whose volume is less than over-pack volume arenot eliminated during the picking process. By doing this, the Sterling WarehouseManagement System ensures that the products are not picked in UOMs thatrequire over-pack. The demand in these UOMs are picked as loose inventory, andtherefore assists containerization in over-packing."
Pick Strategy and Processes,"A Pick strategy is applied to waves to determine the pick processes and locationsto use when picking inventory.Pick strategy is comprised of:1 Pick Processes2 Pick Location AssignmentThe most commonly used pick processes are:Order Pick—This pick process is applicable for warehouses that perform pickoperations for a small number of orders, but high number of item picks for eachorder. Warehouses performing a low number of pick operations for an order findthe travel time excessive. But, warehouses performing pick operations with alarge number of orders find that the congestion from many pickers working inthe same area slows down the pick process.In the Sterling Warehouse Management System, pick tasks are sorted in the samesequence as defined in the pick flow. Users pick one order or shipment at a timefrom the assigned zones.Batch Pick—Multiple orders or shipments are grouped into batches. Constraintsare defined at the batch level for zones, locations, and number of units. Forwarehouses that perform low pick operations for an order, this pick processgreatly reduces the travel time allowing a picker to perform additional picktasks when in the same area. Since multiple orders are picked at the same time,warehouses must ensure not to mix orders. In situations where same dayshipping operations are critical, a balance between the optimal batch pick andshipping requirements must be achieved.Item Pick—Items across orders or shipments are picked from different zones atthe same time and brought to the pack, sorting, or staging locations to sort andconsolidate into individual shipments. These shipments are later moved to therespective pack locations for packing. Warehouses performing pick operationswith low number of items and a moderate to high number of picks for eachorder and item, benefit from the item pick process.Warehouses can determine the appropriate pick process based on the item andshipment attributes. All constraints and controls can be specified at the warehouselevel to handle seasonal or occasional peaks as follows:Choose the item pick process:– When demand at an item category level in a wave exceeds the defined limits.– For items with certain attributes, or shipments with shipment level attributessuch as single unit shipments.1. Choose the order pick process for items with certain attributes or shipmentswith shipment level attributes such as single unit or line shipments.2. Choose the batch pick process for regular and small orders. In the SterlingWarehouse Management System, you can specify zone-based picking as part ofthe batch pick strategy.The determination of pick process is based on the demand, which eliminates themanual handling of end-of-month and end-of-quarter procedures."
Pick Location Assignment,"The Pick Location Assignment (PLA) in the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem assigns locations to satisfy the demand. PLA is defined at the shipmentgroup level and may be shared across multiple shipment groups.When a shipment is added to a wave, the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemdetermines:1. The demand for each distinct item in shipment lines for shipments included inthe wave.2. The inventory and alternate UOMs for itemsIdentifying PLA Rules:PLA rules are defined for an item classification at the UOM level. A PLA rulepoints to a list of zones. Multiple PLA rules may be specified to ensure uniquezone level constraints for each combination of item classification or UOM. Forexample, for SKUs stocked in pallets, cases, and loose units, you can define 3distinct rules to cover zones that are applicable for each UOM.The Sterling Warehouse Management System identifies the PLA rule for a wave byidentifying the appropriate pick processes starting from the biggest UOM definedfor the item.If the pick process determination rules are not defined for a UOM, and if otherconditions are met, the pick processes can be selected using any UOM.DowngradingAbout this taskBased on the demand, if the system determines more than one pick process for aUOM, the pick processes are evaluated in the following order:1. Item Pick2. Order Pick3. Batch PickProcedure1. If the Sterling Warehouse Management System determines that the item pickprocess should be used, it:a. Determines PLA from the UOM specified in the Pick Process Determinationrules.b. Processes all UOM conditions defined starting from the largest UOM (UOMthat corresponds to the highest quantity).c. Performs PLA for the demand.d. Continues to process until the demand is completely satisfied or all UOMconditions are exhausted.2. If the Sterling Warehouse Management System determines that the order pickor batch pick process should be used, it:a. Determines PLA from the UOM specified in the:1. Pick Process Determination rules (applicable only for the order pickprocess)2. UOM Conditionb. Performs PLA for the demand.ResultsIf a demand is not fulfilled by a pick process, it is carried forward to either thenext pick process defined for that UOM. Otherwise, the demand is carried forwardto the pick process defined for the next highest UOM.The PLA algorithm checks for inventory availability in zones that are configuredfor pickingHonoring Split ConstraintsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System validates the LPN split constraintsdefined at the zone and PLA rule levels. These constraints determine whether alicense plate can be split during inventory allocation. If split constraints are definedat the zone and PLA rule levels, the system chooses the most restrictive constraintto ensure that constraints defined are not violated.The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables you to specify the UOM forproducts stored at a zone. If a UOM is specified:1. Users pick products in multiples of the specified UOM or full LPNs of the sameLPN type associated with the UOM.2. Users pick the entire quantity at the location if it matches the demand.For example, there is a demand for 25 units (1 case). The pallet quantity is 100 andcase quantity is 25. If pallets with cases are stored in a location and thecorresponding zone has a constraint for storing products in multiples of case, theSterling Warehouse Management System enables you to break pallets and pickcases from that location. If the zone is configured to store products in multiples ofpallet, then breaking pallets or picking cases from that zone is not allowed.However, in both scenarios, the Sterling Warehouse Management System enablesyou to pick the entire pallet from the zone.If a split UOM constraint is defined at a zone level, the UOM must be defined forall items in that zone.Split constraints defined at the PLA rule level allow you to configure different tasktypes for picking from an LPN or pick full LPNs from the same zone. This isachieved by creating multiple PLA rules for different UOMs.Although replenishment strategies are configured, the Sterling WarehouseManagement System does not perform demand-based replenishment for zones thathave split constraints defined at the PLA rule level or zone level. The existing pendin quantities are also not considered for allocation. This is to avoid violating a splitconstraint because the exact information about the incoming inventory is notavailable. However, you can replenish such zones using the location monitoringrules.Locations with InventoryWhen determining optimal locations, the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemconsiders order line attributes. The system also considers requested tag attributes,if available.The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables you to specify zones withinventory, and utilize the dedicated and dynamic slots in these zones, if applicable.All zones are considered in equal priority, thereby honoring FIFO and ship by date.The Sterling Warehouse Management System assigns pick locations for a zonebased on the ""Least Number of Trips"" or ""Pick-to-Clean"" optimizations. Thefollowing scenario further explains these strategies:Consider that there is a task to pick 35 units of an item. There are 5 locations inzone Z1 with their inventory picture as follows:1. L1: 402. L2: 303. L3: 204. L4: 105. L5: 5For zone Z1, the following constraints are not defined:a. 'inventory is stored in multiples of pallets or cases' constraintb. PLA rule level split constraintsIn this case, for 'Least Number of Trips' optimization, location L1 is suggested. For'Pick-to-Clean' optimization, locations L3, L4, and L5 are suggested.If an item is tracked by its FIFO number, or is a time-sensitive item, the locationhaving the inventory with the minimum FIFO number or ship-by-date is suggestedfirst by the Sterling Warehouse Management System.The following figure illustrates the PLA process for a zone configured for itempick.Dedicated LocationsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System allows the utilization of dedicatedand dynamic slots in the zones specified, if applicable. If dedicated locations donot exist for the demand, locations are determined dynamically in the zonesspecified. However, if dedicated locations exist, they can be allocated for theremaining demand. The Sterling Warehouse Management System ensures thatsufficient inventory exists in bulk zones to replenish the dedicated/dynamic slotlocations. It also allows the creation of a retrieval request for allocated demand tothe dedicated locations. Dedicated locations that cannot be replenished for theentire demand results in PLA exception. The Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem allows applying zone constraints only when locations are determineddynamically. It does not allow mixing of SKUs in dynamic slotted locations unlessit is an infinite location.Pick Fence LocationsDuring peak times for a SKU the dedicated and dynamic slot locations are toosmall to occupy the demand even at a wave level. In such situations, the SterlingWarehouse Management System allows defining pick fence and its correspondingzone. The SKU quantity is deposited to the pick fence location (typically a floorlocation), where picking tasks are completed. Pick locations that are found result inPLA exception, and the Sterling Warehouse Management System ensures that aretrieval request is created for the entire demand to the pick locations. However,pick locations that cannot be replenished for the entire demand also results in PLAexception.Cross Dock LocationsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System allows for inbound shipments at thewarehouse to be considered as available inventory, after searching for inventory inother locations, as explained in the previous sections.The task types that are assigned to each location are specified at a PLA rule level.This allows a warehouse to have a different task type for a pallet pick, case pickand loose pick, by utilizing the combination of UOM and zones.The Sterling Warehouse Management System triggers demand based replenishmenttasks for the forward pick locations, considering the demand placed during thePLA process and the inventory availability for a SKU at the location."
Replenishment,"In a warehouse, as a product is removed from a location, the inventory in thatlocation requires re-stocking. This process is called replenishment. Demand-basedreplenishment is initiated after PLA has specified the total demand placed for anitem. A retrieval request is created by PLA for the demand.The replenishment strategy is specified for a zone that requires replenishment. Thezones to replenish from can be specified by the unit of measure that is required.For example, an active (loose) pick zone is replenished from case storage zone forthe UOM specified as EACH, while the case storage zone is replenished from thepallet zone when the unit of measure is CASE. Additional zones can be specifiedas secondary preferences in both these cases. During the replenishment process,zone attributes such as round-off level, controls the optimal quantity suggested forreplenishment. For example, in case storage zone, the quantity to replenish can berounded up to a case quantity for the item, while in a pallet zone, quantity toreplenish can be rounded up to a pallet quantity for the item.The Sterling Warehouse Management System groups demand-based tasks based onthe department requesting replenishment. For example, PLA for a wave createsboth replenishment task and pick task. Typically, replenishment tasks are expectedto precede pick tasks for a wave. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemmay be configured such that pick tasks are kept on hold until inventory isreplenished and made available for picking for the entire batch, shipment, orcontainer."
Containerization,"Containerization is the process of using standardized containers for the storage andtransport of loose units from a warehouse. The containers used for containerizationare defined in Catalog Management.If you pack during picking, the results of containerization are used during picking.If you pack after picking, the results of containerization are used during packing.When packing is performed it is specified as part of the task type configuration inpick planning. This decision affects the way in which containerization logic works.However, the parameters that govern the logic remain the same regardless of whenpacking is performed.The following constraints are evaluated during containerization:1. Buyer specific constraints include:a. Whether the container requires shipment container markingb. The level at which shipment container markings are appliedc. Whether items can be mixed in a case based on different parameters, such asitem ID, mark for address, unit of measured. Whether items can be mixed in a pallet based on different parameters, such asitem ID, mark for address, unit of measure2. Warehouse/Enterprise specific constraints include:a. Whether items can be mixed in a case based on different parameters, such asitem ID, mark for address, unit of measureb. Whether items can be mixed in a pallet based on different parameters, such asitem ID, mark for address, unit of measurec. Which containers can be usedd. Whether the container requires shipment container marking based on parceland less-than truckload/truckload shipmentse. The level at which shipment container markings are applied based on parceland less-than truckload/truckload shipments3. Container specific constraints include:a. The Buyer on the shipment lineb. The shipment line item's containerization categoryc. The volume of the container that can be usedd. The maximum weight the container can holde. The quantity of a particular item the container can hold, based on itemclassificationIn addition to the standard industry constraints, the Sterling WarehouseManagement System ensures that a container does not contain multiple shipments,task types, items requiring different value-added services, and container categories.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the initial containerizationestimate to determine the pick strategy, which is recalculated during wave releasein accordance with PLA.A warehouse can also choose manual post-pick containerization. In this case apacker provides details about the shipment container chosen, and the items in thecontainer. For example, warehouses that handle soft items defy regular area,volume calculations, like clothes that have a 'squish' ratio or warehouses that donot have standard packs defined or are in the process of establishing the same.During containerization, the system creates Pallet labels if the item has an alternateUOM with LPN type = Pallet and containerization quantity matches the alternateUOM quantity. But for Parcel shipments, the creation of Pallet labels can beprevented by setting the propertyyfs.prevent.palletlabel.for.parcelshipment.tasktypelist to a list of task typesseparated by commas. If this property is not set or if the task is not among the tasktypes mentioned in the property value list, the system will retain the defaultbehavior.For more information about containerization, see the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem: Configuration Guide"
Batching,"Activities or processes in a warehouse are carried out on equipment that has theirown size or quantity restrictions. The different activities in a warehouse includepicking, retrieval for replenishment. The tasks are grouped into 'batches' ofactivities based on the equipment used to complete these tasks.Batch pick is defined as picking of multiple tasks across shipments in one trip. Abatch is picked either using equipment like carts or flatbeds or totes. Equipmentconstraints limit the number of units that is picked in one trip due to slots beingdefined in carts or physical limitations.The different methods of batch pick include:1. Pick—This process involves picking of multiple shipments into a single tote. Thepicked quantity is deposited at a pack station where packing slips or RadioFrequency (RF) Mobile Terminal scanners are used to pack the individualshipments.2. Sort while pick—This process involves picking of quantity into specific totesdetermined by the system. Each tote represents either a shipment or carton in ashipment. The picked quantity can now be dropped off at a pack station at atote level.3. Sort and pack while pick—This process involves picking of quantity into specificcartons placed in specific slots in a cart or flat bed. Each carton indicates theitem and quantity that needs to be packed in it as well as the size of carton. Thepicked cartons can now be individually dropped at packing station wherepacking slip is applied and carton is closed.The locations assigned for pick are also considered when building the optimalbatch. The optimal batch is determined by calculating cost of picking using criteriaincluding number of trips, number of locations visited and the number of aisles tobe visited, to determine the batch that takes the least time.Shipping Specific SerialsWhen a customer requests for shipments with serial numbers, the SterlingWarehouse Management System creates Move Requests for such shipments andreleases to the pack station."
Building a Cart Manually,"The manual cart build functionality provides the ability to build a picking cart byassociating a cart location to a set of totes, cartons or shipments.Cart build also provides the ability to capture the productivity of a user."
Printing Documents for a Wave,"The operation of a warehouse requires numerous documents, be it labels orreports, to be printed daily. The printing of the documents is either initiated by theoccurrence of specific events or requested ad hoc by a user. The SterlingWarehouse Management System provides necessary documentation to complete theoutbound processes. Documents are printed either individually or in a set orgroup. A document set consists of multiple documents that relate to individualactivity that is performed. The Sterling Warehouse Management System supportsprinting of standard documents for waves.Printing Carrier LabelsThe Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the ability to print carriercarton labels during wave release or at the time of manifest. To print labels duringwave release, the Sterling Warehouse Management System may generate a trackingnumber and print the labels for cartons that are manifested later."
Visibility,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides comprehensive visibility toshipments and waves through consoles. The combinations of the attributes arebetter illustrated through the following use cases or examples:v View waves status for priority UPS ShipmentsCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, status range and shipment group idrepresenting priority UPS shipmentsv View waves that are scheduled to release for tomorrowCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, status range and release no earlierthan date and timev View all shipments for a buyer that are included in wave expected to ship bytomorrowCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, buyer, select 'Shipment In Wave',select 'Enter Shipment Dates' to enter requested ship datesv View all shipments that are on a specific trailerCriteria used include ship node, enterprise and trailer number.v View all shipments that are picked or packed for a specific item that requiresadditional inspectionCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, item and status.v View all pick lists that have been created today for a specific carrierCriteria used include ship node, carrier and pick list date rangev View all loose cases that belong to a specific shipment that are awaiting pickCriteria used include ship node, container type, select 'Loose Quantity', shipmentnumber and status range"
Outbound Execution,"Outbound Execution covers the process from the point when pick tasks arereleased for an outbound shipment up to the point when the packages are loadedinto trailers.The seamless and flawless execution is an integral part of how reduced orderturnaround time and inventory accuracy is achieved. The ability of a system tomirror the routing of inventory in order to comply with the customer and itemrequirements are the key to reduced turnaround time. The following figureillustrates the relationship between Order Pipeline, Shipment Pipeline, andContainer Pipeline.Shipment specific attributes further define the process to be followed duringpicking and packing. For example, shipments are loaded in stop-off fashiondemanding that the picking and packing process be done in a certain sequence.LTL and TL require pallets to be built from individual containers. Parcel shipmentsare shipped at an individual carton or container level.Shipments requiring additional VAS activity are routed through the appropriatedepartments. Items that require assembly referred to as 'physical kits' are alsorouted through the VAS department. VAS activities, such as customer specificlabeling, monogramming, price ticketing and gift-wrapping deferred till the last minute are part of ""postponement"" strategies employed. The diverse nature of theVAS requirements enforces the need to track each individual process.The complex and shipment specific nature of the processes enforces the need tohave visibility to a shipment at a granular level.Outbound execution in the Sterling Warehouse Management System is a result ofthe strategies employed during the release of shipments. The flow of activity in awarehouse is modeled through business process configuration at a shipmentattribute level in a warehouse.An activity in a warehouse is modeled through a task type. Additional constraintsare defined at a task type level to control the execution. Task Managementmanages and monitors all tasks. Shipment selectors that are defined allow awarehouse to group shipments by attributes including 'Pack & Hold' or 'VAS.'A task is completed through Radio Frequency (RF) Mobile Terminal, batch sheet orinterfacing with appropriate MHE. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemallows the deployment of different pick strategies including ""sort while pick,"" ""pickand sort,"" ""pick and pass"" in a warehouse. Also, a warehouse can choose to havebatch picking in the shelves, RF Mobile Terminal picking in bulk and put to lightsystems in active zones.Picking, packing and shipping procedures also adhere to the compliancerequirements at a customer, carrier level. Customs compliance is also enforced forinternational shipments. The requirements include appropriate labeling anddocumentation. The generation and printing of these documents is modeledthrough events in the business process configuration against a transaction. TheEvent Management then dispatches these prints through the application's printinfrastructure.The Sterling Warehouse Management System business process configuration atboth a shipment and container level allows quality control processes to beenforced. This improves the inventory accuracy of shipments, thereby improvingcustomer satisfaction.Parcel shipments are processed through a manifesting console. The Parcel CarrierAdapters (Carrier Adapter) provides integration to carrier-specific services,including FedEx Ship Manager, and other external carrier servers.LTL and TL shipments require creation of BOL. The Sterling WarehouseManagement System provides the VICS standard BOL. Trailer manifests or MasterBOL is also provided to carriers, if necessary.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides complete control over theexecution process at a granular level. A shipment can be monitored, managed andprocessed through consoles. The Sterling Warehouse Management System providescomplete control over modifications done at a shipment line level."
Picking,"Picking tasks are carried out by RF Mobile Terminal, batch sheet or by interfacingwith a MHE.During the pick process, appropriate instructions for pick and pack are provided tothe user. Additional attributes such as serial numbers can be captured during the picking process. Pick strategy determines the method of pick for a SKU on theshipment. Pick strategies including ""pick and sort"", ""sort while pick"", ""order pick"",""pick and pass"" and ""zone based pick"" are supported. For small products that arenot received in standard cases, the Sterling Warehouse Management System allowsover-picking if the excess quantity picked does not exceed preset over-ship limits.Users are assigned to specific task types and equipment associated with their skillset. The controls provided to a supervisor allow a shipment to be restricted tospecific users and to the number of users who can work on the task. This allows awarehouse to leverage assets appropriately. For example, a warehouse where TLshipments are restricted to one or two users provides batch pick to a larger groupof users.The Sterling Warehouse Management System always attempts to consolidateoutbound pick tasks before suggesting to the user.Ability is provided to a picker to record exceptions such as short picks at alocation.The Sterling Warehouse Management System lets you pick, pack and ship morethan the shipment line quantity, as long as the quantity picked is within the settolerance limit.Thus you can pick and pack more than the shipment line quantity. Over picking isallowed as long as the quantity picked (sum of the shipment line quantity and theover ship quantity) is within the set tolerance limit.At the end of the picking process, the inventory is moved through drop-offlocations to the next point in the route. After all pick tasks are completed for awave, the wave status is appropriately updated.Task management automatically assigns the next task to the picker based onbusiness process configuration and priorities at a task type level. In the event, thata specific shipment requires to be moved to a higher priority, a supervisor uses theconsole to modify the priority manually. A user is assigned the task based on thepriority. This reduces the need for a supervisor to call out or walk up to a user toindicate which shipment or task they need to work on."
Outbound Value-Added Services,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables a warehouse to configuredifferent VAS operations as part of outbound shipment.Inventory picked for shipments that require VAS processing is putaway to the VASdepartment. VAS processes are diverse based on the type of item being processed.For example:1 Gift-wrapping each individual package with a personalized card.2 Monogramming on garments.3 Grinding coffee seeds to the required grind level.4 Assembly of a mobile phone with the appropriate front panel.5 Frequency programmingVAS operations may also apply only to a single carton in the shipment. This typeof VAS operation is customer based and not based on the item picked in theshipment. Examples include, inserting marketing materials, return labels orpackets, or inserting packing list.All VAS processes are recorded through a VAS Station. A station is associated withactivities that can be performed. A work order is associated with multiple activitiesthat may be confirmed individually.The completion of the VAS activities automatically initiates the next step in theroute. Visibility is provided at a shipment level for the VAS work order."
Packing Cartons and Pallets,"Packing operations or confirmation is performed on completion of the pickingand/or VAS operations at a SKU level.Certain pick strategies including ""sort while pick"" and ""pick and pass"" combinepacking activity along with the pick. The pack process in this scenario is closing ofthe carton after insertion of appropriate material.The pack process in other pick strategies including ""pick and sort"" is performed atthe completion of pick of the entire wave or shipment.The packing process captures additional information like serial numbers, ship bydate and weight. Serial number is captured during the pack process only if thewarehouse does not capture serial number as an inventory attribute. The SterlingWarehouse Management System automatically determines the weight of acontainer using the attributes at an item level and the corrugation weight.However, it is necessary for some warehouses to capture actual weight at a cartonlevel.The packing process ensures customer compliance. Packing is done into acontainer. The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports the ability toassign a unique license plate number or a SCM label to a container. In addition, acontainer may go through further VAS operations to meet additional customerrequirements. Instructions to the customer or carrier compliance requirements likepallet height restrictions and stacking restrictions are provided.Documentation is provided during the packing step based on the customercompliance or as per business process configuration. For example, customercompliance requirements to have packing list for each carton or only for the lastcarton.The packing process for a Sterling Warehouse Management System-containerizedcarton directs the user to pack contents of the cartons. Visibility is provided to auser to the expected contents of a carton. A warehouse that choose to manuallypack cartons after the pick operation is referred to as 'post-pick containerization',which records the license plate number and contents being packed at stations. Apacker is informed of completion of the container packing or of an exceptionimmediately. In the manual packing process, a packer informs the system ofcompletion.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also supports the feature of packingat a shipment level. A shipment is sorted into multiple pallets or cartons andunique license plate numbers or SCM labels are applied. The shipment is considered as packed upon user confirmation of the labels associated with it.However, the contents of each individual carton are not known.A single item broken into multiple physical containers is also supported in thismanner. For example, a table where the legs and individual table are physicalshipped as two or more containers. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemensures that the number of containers associated with the item is packed.Freight charges for parcel shipments are placed at an individual container level.LTL and TL shipments are typically charged for their weight. Individual standardcases are placed along with other items into a larger carton or multiple cartons areshrink-wrapped together to optimize on the total charge for parcel shipments. Thisis referred to as ""over-pack"".Quality processes to ensure picking and packing accuracy and customercompliance are enforced through business process configuration or through ad-hocprocesses. The QC operator marks a container if the check fails.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides procedures for directedbuilding of pallets by associating an outbound pallet to the shipment. A packerindicates when a pallet is complete and associates a new pallet with the shipment.A packer is instructed to place a container for a shipment into the appropriatepallet.The license plate or the SCM label associated to the pallet allows subsequentmovements on the scan of the label, into the trailer or to the appropriate shippinglane.A shipment container or pallet is passed through a manifesting station in the caseof pallet shipments or to a shipping lane awaiting trailer loading.Documentation required in the inside of a container or on the outside of a pallet orcontainer is automated through the raising of appropriate events to theapplication’s print infrastructure."
Pack and Hold,The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows a warehouse to pick and packshipments that are marked as 'Pack and Hold.' These pallets or cartons areputaway to appropriate locations for later retrieval.Tasks are automatically created for a container based on the ship date attribute of ashipment.The Sterling Warehouse Management System also supports last minutemodifications to indicate that a shipment must be put on 'Pack and Hold.' It alsoprovides complete location level visibility to all containers of a shipment.
Outbound Sorting,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables a warehouse to sortoutbound shipment containers into a location. Once a shipment container is sortedat a particular location, the system suggests the same location for other containersof the shipment until the user manually overrides the location."
Shipping,"Shipping in the Sterling Warehouse Management System can be either LTL, TL, orParcel shipments.Dock SchedulingThe Dock Scheduling functionality of the Sterling Warehouse Management Systemenables you to manage all dock locations in a warehouse for receiving inboundshipments and shipping outbound shipments. The dock scheduling rules enablesthe user to specify number of days in advance to take a dock appointment.The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables you to associate a dockschedule with a shipment or load. If scheduling is done for a shipment, theSterling Warehouse Management System provides complete visibility into theshipment volume, weight, number of cartons available, and pallet information.Based on the Productivity Metrics (SAM definition), the duration of theappointment is also suggested.Dock scheduling is based on the warehouse calendar associated with a dock andconsiders all working days and holidays, and shifts that are valid for receiving orshipping operations. Each dock can have its own calendar and shifts specifiedwhen they are available. You may also exclude certain docks from the schedulingprocess. For example, a warehouse may allocate one dock for UPS fluid loading,which may require one full day. In this case, dock appointment is not required forUPS fluid loading.Each appointment is assigned a unique reference number. The time slot assignedfor each appointment may vary based on the shipment size. For example, theduration for one appointment could be for 30 minutes and another appointmentcould vary between 45 minutes to 1 hour. Appointments can be changed to afuture date in case the delivery fails. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemcreates alerts for such missed deliveries or pickups to ensure that newappointments are created. The Sterling Warehouse Management System alsoenables the cancellation of appointments that are already taken.Due to additional resource constraints, a warehouse may not want to take morethan a certain number of appointments at a given time. For example, if 20 docksare available for taking appointments, a warehouse may not want to schedule all20 docks from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, as it may not be possible for a warehouse tounload all 20 trucks at the same time.Appointments can be taken only for the number of days specified in advance.Less-Than-Truckload or Truckload ShipmentsTypically, LTL and TL shipments are physically sorted into pallets at a carrier level.For LTL carriers, the Sterling Warehouse Management System can automaticallygenerate PRO numbers.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides a VICS-compliant BOL foreach shipment. Additional documentation for customs including commercialinvoices and NAFTA ship by date documents can also be printed.A shipment is marked as 'Shipped' upon confirmation at a BOL level or at a trailerlevel.Trailer LoadingA load consists of a single shipment or multiple shipments. In TL and LTLshipments, it is critical to ensure that all pallets and containers are loaded into thecorrect trailer to ensure shipment accuracy and customer satisfaction.A trailer manifest or Master BOL is printed for the load, if necessary.Visibility is provided at a load, shipment and container level for a trailer indicatingwhich containers have been loaded."
Manifesting,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports both LTL and ParcelManifests. The following sections provides a brief description about both manifests.Parcel ManifestParcel shipment containers are processed through the manifest station. Eachcontainer is associated with the appropriate carrier's manifest at the station. Forparcel shipments, the Sterling Warehouse Management System is capable ofcreating loads and load containers that can be manifested.The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports parcel manifest proceduresfor parcel carriers including UPS, FedEx, USPS, and Purolator. Carrier-specificrequirements are automatically provided at the station. For example, FedExrequires that each container being added to the manifest to obtain a trackingnumber from its Ship Manager Server.The Sterling Warehouse Management System supports multiple billing optionssuch as prepaid, collect and third party billing that are provided by the parcelcarriers. International and domestic shipments are also supported. Special servicesfor a carrier are also provided, which can be added or removed as needed.The Sterling Warehouse Management System is configured appropriately at acarrier or SCAC level, to pre-generate tracking numbers and labels.A manifest station processes containers belonging to multiple carriers. However,physical requirements or printer type compliance forces a warehouse to have adedicated station for specific carriers. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemalso supports building of pallets for shipments to allow movements of containersat the pallet license plate level to the manifest station.Integration is provided for in-line weighing scales, such as Mettler Toledo. TheSterling Warehouse Management System allows a warehouse to integrate withweighing scales connected to the MHE devices. In such situations, weight of thepackage is recorded as and when the container is diverted through MHE. Manualentry of weight is also allowed.A unique manifest number is assigned by the Sterling Warehouse ManagementSystem or provided by the user. Parcel carriers provide tracking at both manifest level and individual container level. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemprovides the capability to capture the return tracking number for carriers thatsupport return services.Typically, containers are fluid-loaded into the parcel truck. Confirmation of amanifest as an end-of-day process confirms the individual cartons as 'Shipped.'Shipments that are added to a manifest gets shipped on closing the manifest. TheSterling Warehouse Management System supports Synchronous and Asynchronousclosure of manifests, with the default being Synchronous closure. When manifestsare closed synchronously, errors, if any are reported to the user on submitting theclosure request. However, when closed Asynchronously, the user would need tocheck for alerts/errors in the Alert Console. The manifest status ""Closure Failed""indicates occurrence of errors while closing the manifest.LTL ManifestSimilar to parcel manifesting, all parent containers in LTL shipments and loads canbe manifested. The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides the ability toinclude the entire load into a manifest, instead of manifesting individualcontainers. Upon confirming an LTL manifest, apart from LTL BOLs, a TrailerManifest for all loads included in the manifest gets printed."
Exceptions in Outbound Execution,"The activities during pick, pack, VAS and ship are dependent on the inventoryavailable at each step. Typically, exceptions that occur in a warehouse include shortpicks, customer requests for cancellation of entire order or part of order.Modifications of carrier assigned, rebuild of pallets or re-containerization at ashipment level are also allowed.In the case of a short pick, the picker requests for an alternate location. TheSterling Warehouse Management System automatically records a discrepancyagainst the location. If inventory is not found, the carton is marked as short pickand the shipment requires resolution after interaction with the customer.A customer requests to modify an order or place an order on credit hold. Theshipment corresponding on the order requires to be stopped. If necessary, theshipment needs to be cancelled. The Sterling Warehouse Management Systemfacilitates this process by allowing moving of this carton into a problem area forresolution. Depending on the activities that have been completed on this carton,the picking and packing are undone. Inventory is created in the problem resolutionthat is putaway based on the algorithm.The Sterling Warehouse Management System allows a problem container or palletto be removed from the appropriate trailer or manifest before closing the manifest.At a shipment level carrier modification, re-containerization and re-building ofpallets are allowed.Cancellation of a wave automatically cancels the corresponding batches and tasksfor all shipments.Manual move request for putaway or retrieval is provided for ad-hoc moves ofinventory into locations that have shortage.The Sterling Warehouse Management System enables you to move products thatare already allocated. After moving the allocated products into the location, thesystem automatically cancels the corresponding putaway task for these products.The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides comprehensive visibility toshipment status. Audits are also provided at each step of the process to monitoruser productivity and quick resolution."
Visibility,"The Sterling Warehouse Management System provides comprehensive visibility toshipments, containers, waves through consoles. The combinations of the attributesare better illustrated through the following use cases or examples:a View all shipments packed for a carrierCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, carrier and status.b View all shipments for which there is a shipping delay due to bad weatherCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, select 'Enter Shipment Dates' to entertoday's date and status range.c View all shipments that are part of a specific loadCriteria used include ship node, enterprise and load number.d View shipments for a LTL or TL shipments using attributesCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, shipment mode and BOL or PRO#,Trailer#.e View shipments that are waiting for pickupCriteria used include ship node, enterprise, delivery method and status range.f View all containers that are packed and not manifested for a specific carrierCriteria used include ship node, select 'Un-manifested Containers Only' andstatus range"
